abstract = {It is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.},

A surprising constancy in each of these properties is revealed as webs are collapsed down to approximately half their original size. This analysis of 60 invertebrate-dominated community food webs confirms the existence of all but one of these properties in such webs and addresses a common concern held by critics of food web theory that observed food web properties may be sensitive to trophic aggregation. The food web statistics (chain length; predator/prey ratio; fraction of top, intermediate, and bottom species; and rigid circuits) are scaling in the sense that they remain roughly invariant over a wide range of data resolution. As such, within present standards of reporting food web data, these statistics may be used to compare systems whose trophic data are resolved differently within a factor of 2.},

abstract = {Introduced predators account for a large part of the extinction of endemic insular species, which constitutes a major component of the loss of biodiversity among vertebrates. Eradication of alien predators from these ecosystems is often considered the best solution. In some ecosystems, however, it can generate a greater threat for endemic prey through what is called the "mesopredator release". This process predicts that, once superpredators are suppressed, a burst of mesopredators may follow which leads their shared prey to extinction. This process is studied through a mathematical model describing a three species system (prey-mesopredator-superpredator). Analysis of the model, with and without control of meso- and superpredators, shows that this process does indeed exist and can drive shared prey to rapid extinction. This work emphasizes that, although counter-intuitive, eradication of introduced superpredators, such as feral domestic cats, is not always the best solution to protect endemic prey when introduced mesopredators, such as rats, are also present.},

@article{DeAngelis2015,
abstract = {Ye et al. (1) address a critical problem con-fronting the management of natural ecosys-tems: How can we make forecasts of possible future changes in populations to help guide management actions? This problem is espe-cially acute for marine and anadromous fisher-ies, where the large interannual fluctuations of populations, arising from complex nonlinear interactions among species and with varying environmental factors, have defied prediction over even short time scales. The empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) described in Ye et al.'s report, the latest in a series of papers by Sugihara and his colleagues, offers a promising quantitative approach to building models using time series to successfully pro-ject dynamics into the future. With the term " equation-free " in the arti-cle title, Ye et al. (1) are suggesting broader implications of their approach, considering the centrality of equations in modern science. From the 1700s on, nature has been increas-ingly described by mathematical equations, with differential or difference equations forming the basic framework for describing dynamics. The use of mathematical equations for ecological systems came much later, pio-neered by Lotka and Volterra, who showed that population cycles might be described in terms of simple coupled nonlinear differential equations. It took decades for Lotka–Volterra-type models to become established, but the development of appropriate differential equa-tions is now routine in modeling ecological dynamics. There is no question that the in-jection of mathematical equations, by forcing " clarity and precision into conjecture " (2), has led to increased understanding of population and community dynamics. As in science in general, in ecology equations are a key method of communication and of framing hypotheses. These equations serve as compact representations of an enormous amount of empirical data and can be analyzed by the powerful methods of mathematics. However, mathematics has not had the " unreasonable effectiveness " in ecology that it has had in physics. Critics point out that models in ecology have not passed the crite-rion of predictive ability (3, 4). There are many reasons for this, one being the highly nonlinear nature of ecological interactions. This has led to arguments over whether the " right " models are being used, but also to broad opinion that, unlike in physics, there are no right models to describe the dynamics of ecological systems, and that the best that can be done is to find models that are at least good approximations for the phenomena they are trying to describe. It is common in introductions of ecological modeling to find descriptions of the " modeling cycle, " in which a question is formulated, hypotheses are made, a model structure is chosen in the form of variables and equations, the equations are parameterized according to best information, and the model is analyzed and compared with patterns in nature. The cycle can be repeated again and again to obtain the best fit or validation by data. Although this methodology may work for some cases, it has become clear that there are limits on the ac-curacy of models applied to systems, with many variables interacting nonlinearly to cre-ate complex dynamics (e.g., marine ecosys-tems). Complete parameterization of models of such systems is nearly impossible. Further-more, the nonlinearities of ecological systems cause models to be so sensitive to structure and parameters that even the most thoroughly and carefully developed model can hardly be expected to be predictive (5–7). The message of Ye et al.'s report (1) is that there are ways to make predictive forecasts that do not rely on specifying equations at all, thus avoiding the problems outlined above. One can say generally that " the study of nat-ural systems begins and ends with the spec-ification of observables describing such a system, and a characterization of the manner in which these observations are linked " (8). In traditional models, equations are formu-lated with certain functional forms character-izing linkages of variables. For example, the Ricker difference equation model links the number of recruits to a fish population, R t , to population size S i through the relationship R t = S t exp(r – $\alpha$S t), so that population size can be projected ahead to S t+1 at time t + 1. Given a set of time series data from a fishery, the modeler attempts to find values of r and $\alpha$ from the best fit for the equation. Most mod-els are more complex, linking a population's},

These multipotent spots either replicate or differentiate into other types of spots with different fixed-point dynamics, and as a result, an inhomogeneous pattern of spots is formed. This differentiation process of spots is analyzed in terms of the loss of chemical diversity and decrease of the local Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The relevance of the results to developmental cell biology and stem cells is also discussed.},

Predicting population growth characteristics based on knowledge of heterogeneous single-cell dynamics remains challenging. By observing groups of cells for hundreds of generations at single-cell resolution, we reveal that growth noise causes clonal populations of Escherichia coli to double faster than the mean doubling time of their constituent single cells across a broad set of balanced-growth conditions. We show that the population-level growth rate gain as well as age structures of populations and of cell lineages in competition are predictable. Furthermore, we theoretically reveal that the growth rate gain can be linked with the relative entropy of lineage generation time distributions. Unexpectedly, we find an empirical linear relation between the means and the variances of generation times across conditions, which provides a general constraint on maximal growth rates. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental benefit of noise for population growth, and identify a growth law that sets a “speed limit” for proliferation.},

abstract = {It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner-recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

To date, however, the relationship between the wave geometry and the patterns of amoeboid shape change remains elusive. Here, by using phase map analysis, we show that morphology dynamics of randomly moving Dictyostelium discoideum cells can be characterized by the number, topology, and position of spatial phase singularities, i.e., points that represent organizing centers of rotating waves. A single isolated singularity near the cellular edge induced a rotational protrusion, whereas a pair of singularities supported a symmetric extension. These singularities appeared by strong phase resetting due to de novo nucleation at the back of preexisting waves. Analysis of a theoretical model indicated excitability of the system that is governed by positive feedback from phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate to PI3-kinase activation, and we showed experimentally that this requires F-actin. Furthermore, by incorporating membrane deformation into the model, we demonstrated that geometries of competing waves explain most of the observed semiperiodic changes in amoeboid morphology.},

abstract = {Upon their exit from mitosis, mammalian cells enter a G(1) phase during which they acutely sense all sorts of environmental stimuli. On the basis of these signals that they first need to decipher and integrate, they decide whether to undergo division, differentiation, senescence or apoptosis. We questioned whether, despite the complexity of the G(1) regulatory network, simple organizing principles might be identified that could explain how specific input signals are converted into appropriate cell fates. For this purpose, we formulated a mathematical model of the G(1) regulatory network using a simplified description of activities linked to signal transduction, cell growth, cell division and cell death. Bifurcation analysis of the model revealed the existence of multistability between several attractor states corresponding to G(0)-arrest, G(1)-arrest, S-phase entry and apoptosis cell fates. We further unravelled interlinked feedback and feedforward loops within the G(1) regulatory network that drive the signal-dependent transition between G(0) arrest and the other cell fates. Initially, exit from G(0) and progression in early G(1) entail growth factor-dependent activation of an upstream positive feedback loop that activates the cell-growth machinery. Once ribosome synthesis is restored in G(1), a competition develops between a downstream positive feedback loop, which, upon activation, triggers S phase entry, and stress-activated pathways that promote G(1) arrest. If S phase entry prevails over G(1) arrest, cells are sensitized to apoptosis due to stress-induced activation of pro-apoptotic pathways or repression of pro-survival pathways. Thus, the choice between the four possible cell fates in the G(1) phase relies on the flexibly interlinked growth-activatory and division-activatory modules, certain components of which have antagonistic effects on pathways involved in driving apoptosis and G(1) arrest. The final outcome ultimately depends on the context-dependent coordination between the cell-growth and cell-division processes.},

abstract = {Functional dynamics, introduced in a previous paper [Physica D 138 (2000) 225-250] is analyzed, focusing on the formation of a hierarchical rule to determine the dynamics of the functional value. To study the periodic (or non-fixed) solution, the functional dynamics is separated into fixed and non-fixed parts. It is shown that the fixed parts generate a one-dimensional map by which the dynamics of the functional values of some other parts are determined. Piecewise linear maps with multiple branches are generally created, while an arbitrary one-dimensional map can be embedded into this functional dynamics if the initial function coincides with the identity function over a finite interval. Next, the dynamics determined by the one-dimensional map can again generate a 'meta-map', which determines the dynamics of the generated map. This hierarchy of meta-rules can continue recursively. It is also shown that the dynamics can produce 'meta-chaos' with an orbital instability that is stronger than exponential. The relevance of the generated hierarchy to biological and language systems is discussed, in relation with the formation of syntax of a network. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Tiles are picked up randomly to collide, and with a certain rule they react to form new tiles. A non-trivial growth pattern, called joint growth is found, with which tiles grow by combining tiles successively. This joint growth leads to a power-law distribution of tile sizes, by forming a positive feedback process for reproduction of tiles through cooperative relationship among large tiles. This effective growth is achieved by spontaneous differentiation of time scales: quick process for an autocatalytic network and a slower process with joint growth.

abstract = {The origin of multicellularity is a fundamental open question in biology. For multicellular organisms to evolve from an aggregate of unicellular organisms, cells with an identical genotype must first differentiate into several types. Second, this aggregate of distinct cell types should show better growth than that of an isolated cell in the environment. Third, this cell aggregate should show robustness in the number distribution of differentiated cell types. To reveal how an ensemble of primitive cells achieves these conditions, we developed a dynamical-systems model of cells consisting of chemical components with intracellular catalytic reaction dynamics. The reactions convert external nutrients to internal components for cellular growth, and the divided cells interact through chemical diffusion. We found that cells sharing an identical catalytic network spontaneously differentiate induced by cell-cell interactions, and then achieve cooperative division of labor, the mutual use of products among differentiated cell types, enabling a higher growth rate than that in the unicellular case. This symbiotic differentiation emerged for a class of reaction networks under the condition of nutrient limitation and strong cell-cell interactions. Then, robustness in the cell type distribution was achieved, while instability of collective growth sometimes emerged even among the cooperative cells when the internal reserves of chemical products is dominant. The simplicity and generality of the present mechanism suggests that evolution to multicellularity is a natural consequence of interacting cells with limited resources, being consistent with the behaviors and forms of several extant primitive forms of multicellularity, such as certain bacteria.},

abstract = {Although Turing pattern is one of the most universal mechanisms for pattern formation, in its standard model the number of stripes changes with the system size, since the wavelength of the pattern is invariant. It fails to preserve the proportionality of the pattern, i.e. the ratio of the wavelength to the size, that is often required in biological morphogenesis. To get over this problem, we show that the Turing pattern can preserve proportionality by introducing a catalytic chemical whose concentration depends on the system size. Several plausible mechanisms for such size dependence of the concentration are discussed. Following this general discussion, two models are studied in which arising Turing patterns indeed preserve the proportionality. Relevance of the present mechanism to biological morphogenesis is discussed from the viewpoint of its generality, robustness, and evolutionary accessibility. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The number of molecules involved in a cell or subcellular structure is sometimes rather small. In this situation, ordinary macroscopic-level fluctuations can be overwhelmed by non-negligible large fluctuations, which results in drastic changes in chemical-reaction dynamics and statistics compared to those observed under a macroscopic system (i.e., with a large number of molecules). In order to understand how salient changes emerge from fluctuations in molecular number, we here quantitatively define small-number effect by focusing on a "mesoscopic" level, in which the concentration distribution is distinguishable both from micro- and macroscopic ones and propose a criterion for determining whether or not such an effect can emerge in a given chemical reaction network. Using the proposed criterion, we systematically derive a list of motifs of chemical reaction networks that can show small-number effects, which includes motifs showing emergence of the power law and the bimodal distribution observable in a mesoscopic regime with respect to molecule number. The list of motifs provided herein is helpful in the search for candidates of biochemical reactions with a small-number effect for possible biological functions, as well as for designing a reaction system whose behavior can change drastically depending on molecule number, rather than concentration. },

abstract = {The proper functioning of multicellular organisms requires the robust establishment of precise proportions between distinct cell-types. This developmental differentiation process typically involves intracellular regulatory and stochastic mechanisms to generate cell-fate diversity as well as intercellular mechanisms to coordinate cell-fate decisions at tissue level. We thus surmise that key insights about the developmental regulation of cell-type proportion can be captured by the modeling study of clustering dynamics in population of inhibitory-coupled noisy bistable systems. This general class of dynamical system is shown to exhibit a very stable two-cluster state, but also frustrated relaxation, collective oscillations or steady-state hopping which prevents from timely and reliably reaching a robust and well-proportioned clustered state. To circumvent these obstacles or to avoid fine-tuning, we highlight a general strategy based on dual-time positive feedback loops, such as mediated through transcriptional versus epigenetic mechanisms, which improves proportion regulation by coordinating early and flexible lineage priming with late and firm commitment. This result sheds new light on the respective and cooperative roles of multiple regulatory feedback, stochasticity and lateral inhibition in developmental dynamics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-cell level studies are being used increasingly to measure cell properties not directly observable in a cell population. High-performance data acquisition systems for such studies have, by necessity, developed in synchrony. However, improvements in sample purification techniques are also required to reveal new phenomena. Here we assessed a cell sorter as a sample-pretreatment tool for a single-cell level assay. A cell sorter is routinely used for selecting one type of cells from a heterogeneous mixture of cells using specific fluorescence labels. In this case, we wanted to select cells of exactly the same size, shape, and cell-cycle stage from a population, without using a specific fluorescence label. RESULTS: We used four light scatter parameters: the peak height and area of the forward scatter (FSheight and FSarea) and side scatter (SSheight and SSarea). The rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, a neuronal cell line, was used for all experiments. The living cells concentrated in the high FSarea and middle SSheight/SSarea fractions. Single cells without cell clumps were concentrated in the low SS and middle FS fractions, and in the higher FSheight/FSarea and SSheight/SSarea fractions. The cell populations from these viable, single-cell-rich fractions were divided into twelve subfractions based on their FSarea-SSarea profiles, for more detailed analysis. We found that SSarea was proportional to the cell volume and the FSarea correlated with cell roundness and elongation, as well as with the level of DNA in the cell. To test the method and to characterize the basic properties of the isolated single cells, sorted cells were cultured in separate wells. The cells in all subfractions survived, proliferated and differentiated normally, suggesting that there was no serious damage. The smallest, roundest, and smoothest cells had the highest viability. There was no correlation between proliferation and differentiation. NGF increases cell viability but decreases the proliferative ability of the PC12 cells. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a pretreatment method to collect well-characterized, viable, single cells without using fluorescent labels and without significant damage to the cells. This method is quantitative, rapid, single-step, and yields cells of high purity, making it applicable for a variety of single-cell level analyses.},

The mechanisms of this transition, which is known as the small-size transition, can be attributed to either a relative increase in the noise intensity or to the discreteness of the state space due to the small system size. The former mechanism has been intensively investigated using several toy and realistic models. However, the latter has rarely been analyzed and is sometimes confused with the former, because a toy model that extracts the essence of the discreteness-induced transition mechanism is lacking. In this work, we propose a 1- and 3-body reaction system as a minimal model of the discreteness-induced transition and derive the conditions under which this transition occurs in more complex systems.

abstract = {Boundary-induced pattern formation from a spatially uniform state is investigated using one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations. The temporal oscillation is successively transformed into a spatially periodic pattern, triggered by diffusion from the fixed boundary. We introduced a spatial map, whose temporal sequence, under selection criteria from multiple stationary solutions, can completely reproduce the emergent pattern, by replacing the time with space. The relationship of the pattern wavelength with the period of oscillation is also obtained. The generality of the pattern selection process and algorithm is discussed with possible relevance to biological morphogenesis.},

abstract = {From ants to humans, the timing of many animal behaviors comes in bursts of activity separated by long periods of inactivity. Recently, mathematical modeling has shown that simple algorithms of priority-driven behavioral choice can result in bursty behavior. To experimentally test this link between decision-making circuitry and bursty dynamics, we have turned to Drosophila melanogaster. We have found that the statistics of intervals between activity periods in endogenous activity-rest switches of wild-type Drosophila are very well described by the Weibull distribution, a common distribution of bursty dynamics in complex systems. The bursty dynamics of wild-type Drosophila walking activity are shown to be determined by this inter-event distribution alone and not by memory effects, thus resembling human dynamics. Further, using mutant flies that disrupt dopaminergic signaling or the mushroom body, circuitry implicated in decision-making, we show that the degree of behavioral burstiness can be modified. These results are thus consistent with the proposed link between decision-making circuitry and bursty dynamics, and highlight the importance of using simple experimental systems to test general theoretical models of behavior. The findings further suggest that analysis of bursts could prove useful for the study and evaluation of decision-making circuitry.},

abstract = {Cells generally convert nutrient resources to useful products via energy transduction. Accordingly, the thermodynamic efficiency of this conversion process is one of the most essential characteristics of living organisms. However, although these processes occur under conditions of dynamic metabolism, most studies of cellular thermodynamic efficiency have been restricted to examining steady states; thus, the relevance of dynamics to this efficiency has not yet been elucidated. Here, we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions with anabolism-catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes. Through application of external oscillation in the enzyme abundances, the thermodynamic efficiency of metabolism was found to be improved. This result is in strong contrast with that observed in the oscillatory input, in which the efficiency always decreased with oscillation. This improvement was effectively achieved by separating the anabolic and catabolic reactions, which tend to disequilibrate each other, and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of the antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium. In this case, anti-phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through oscillation of enzyme abundances is essential. This improvement was also confirmed in a model capable of generating autonomous oscillations in enzyme abundances. Finally, the possible relevance of the improvement in thermodynamic efficiency is discussed with respect to the potential for manipulation of metabolic oscillations in microorganisms.},

Numerical results indicate that upwelling events during the spawning season may have a negative impact on larval survival.

abstract = {Fish growth is commonly used as a proxy for fitness but this is only valid if individual growth variation can be interpreted in relation to conspecifics' performance. Unfortunately, assessing individual variation in growth rates is problematic under natural conditions because subjects typically need to be marked, repeated measurements of body size are difficult to obtain in the field, and recaptures may be limited to a few time events which will generally vary among individuals. The analysis of consecutive growth rings (circuli) found on scales and other hard structures offers an alternative to mark and recapture for examining individual growth variation in fish and other aquatic vertebrates where growth rings can be visualized, but accounting for autocorrelations and seasonal growth stanzas has proved challenging. Here we show how mixed-effects modelling of scale growth increments (inter-circuli spacing) can be used to reconstruct the growth trajectories of sea trout (Salmo trutta) and correctly classify 89{\%} of individuals into early or late seaward migrants (smolts). Early migrants grew faster than late migrants during their first year of life in freshwater in two natural populations, suggesting that migration into the sea was triggered by ontogenetic (intrinsic) drivers, rather than by competition with conspecifics. Our study highlights the profound effects that early growth can have on age at migration of a paradigmatic fish migrant and illustrates how the analysis of inter-circuli spacing can be used to reconstruct the detailed growth of individuals when these cannot be marked or are only caught once.},

abstract = {Otolith increment widths have often been used to infer somatic growth history when studying the influence of temperature and food supply. However, there is no functional relationship between otolith accretion rate ('inherent otolith growth') and somatic growth rate; although both may be mediated by temperature and food, the uncoupling of these rates under changing environmental conditions or during ontogenetic transitions can undermine the sensitivity of increment width analyses. We used otolith microstructure analysis to model the daily growth of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus juveniles collected from the North Aegean Sea in July 2007, December 2007 and February 2009. To assess the environmental causes of seasonal variability in growth we used daily outputs of environmental variables from a coupled 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model (POM-ERSEM) as a proxy for the potential environment that fish experienced during their development. According to the simulation, juveniles that hatched in late autumnwinter developed in unfavorable conditions (low temperature, low productivity); however, they exhibited wider otolith increments before metamorphosis. To specifically study environmental influences on the daily growth rates, we used the simulated environmental variables in generalised additive model (GAM) analysis of otolith increment widths, while also taking into con - sideration inherent otolith growth, expressed by the explanatory variables 'previous increment width' and 'age'. The inclusion of the interaction term 'age' x 'sampling period', rather than 'age', accounted for the seasonal effects on ontogenetic changes (timing and duration of metamorphosis) and the differences in growth-selective mortality among samples. Results showed that the daily growth rate of anchovy is influenced by temperature, exhibiting an optimum at 24.5°C, and increases significantly with increased mesozooplankton concentration (i.e. food availability). The analysis highlights that, in order to infer the daily somatic growth from fish otolith increment data and understand the environmental influences, inherent otolith growth has to be disentangled and otolith width trajectories standardised for between-sample differences in ontogenetic changes and growth selective mortality.},

More than 40 years after the collapse of the fishery for Pacific sardine, a renewed fishery has emerged off the west coasts of the United States and Canada. The daily egg production method (DEPM) and acoustic-trawl surveys are performed annually and, to minimize the uncertainties in the estimates, sampling effort needs to be allocated optimally. Here, based on a 12-year dataset including the presence/absence of sardine eggs and concomitant remotely sensed oceanographic variables, a probabilistic generalized additive model is developed to predict spatio-temporal distributions of habitat for the northern stock of Pacific sardine in the California Current. Significant relationships are identified between eggs and sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and the gradient of sea surface altitude. The model accurately predicts the habitat and seasonal migration pattern of sardine, irrespective of spawning condition. The predictions of potential habitat are validated extensively by fishery landings and net-sample data from the northeast Pacific. The predicted habitat can be used to optimize the time and location of the DEPM, acoustic-trawl, and aerial surveys of sardine. The method developed and illustrated may be applicable too to studies of other stocks of sardine and other epipelagic fish in other eastern boundary, upwelling regions.},

abstract = {Fisheries constitute an important economic sector for Morocco, where the species Sardina pilchardus represents the main landings. In acoustic evaluations conducted along the Moroccan coast since 1995, the absence of juveniles in 1996 and 1998 and the collapse of the sardine stock between 1996 and 1997 represent the main events until 2002. Sardines are known to be microphageous planktivores and thus are sensitive to environmental variability. A biogeochemical model coupled to a hydrodynamic model (ROMS) was run over the Canary Current System (199120132002) to investigate the environmental factors that could have played a role in the variability of the sardine spawning. A grid refinement (1/12°) centred on the Saharan Bank (SB) region was built to study the main spawning ground of sardines off northwest Africa. The volume of the potential spawning habitat (PSH) of sardines was defined as a function of depth, temperature and salinity, which are included in the ranges 02013200 m, 15201321°C and 35.8201336.8, respectively. Our modelling frame was able to reproduce the seasonal cycle of temperature, phytoplankton concentration and PSH over the SB. It also captured the warming associated with the negative index of the North Atlantic Oscillation of 199520131997 and allowed a description of the inter-annual variability of the PSH. Our experiment shows that the volume of PSH was much reduced in 1996 compared to the other years. The results suggest that the delay between high abundance of plankton and favourable spawning conditions is a good proxy for determining the recruitment failure of sardine in this oceanic region.},

abstract = {American shad Alosa sapidissima in semelparous and iteroparous populations along its native range are thought to have nearly equivalent lifetime reproductive output due to reciprocal latitudinal trends in fecundity and degree of repeat spawning. Geographic differences in reproductive patterns are believed to be linked to varying environmental conditions, and this fine tuning is considered strong evidence of intraspecific life history evolution in marine fishes. American shad are also multiple or batch spawners, but this reproductive trait has only recently been described. Our objectives were to estimate batch fecundity of American shad in semelparous (St. Johns River, Florida) and iteroparous stocks (York River, Virginia, and Connecticut River, Massachusetts) and to re-evaluate annual and lifetime fecundity in these populations. Hydrated females were collected on the spawning grounds of each river. Hydrated oocytes were counted in subsamples from each ovary, and batch fecundity was estimated gravimetrically. Estimates of hydrated oocytes/g ovary were found to be independent of subsample location in the gonad. Log10 -transformed relationships of batch size and total fish weight were highly significant for females in the St. Johns and York rivers and marginally significant for Connecticut River fish. Adjusting for body size, we found no significant differences in batch size among these stocks. We conclude that batch fecundity of American shad does not vary significantly among semelparous (St. Johns River) and iteroparous (York and Connecticut rivers) populations. In all stocks of American shad, spawning frequency and duration are unknown, and seasonal or lifetime egg production cannot be estimated. Thus, hypotheses portraying latitudinal variation in fecundity as an evolutionary response to decreased levels of iteroparity in stocks of American shad are unconfirmed.},

abstract = {Processes of enrichment, concentration and retention are thought to be important for the successful recruitment of small pelagic fish in upwelling areas, but are difficult to measure. In this study, a novel approach is used to examine the role of spatio-temporal oceanographic variability on recruitment success of the Northern Benguela sardine Sardinops sagax. This approach applies a neural network pattern recognition technique, called a self-organising map (SOM), to a seven-year time series of satellite-derived sea level data. The Northern Benguela is characterised by quasi-perennial upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water and is influenced by intrusions of warm, nutrient-poor Angola Current water from the north. In this paper, these processes are categorised in terms of their influence on recruitment success through the key ocean triad mechanisms of enrichment, concentration and retention. Moderate upwelling is seen as favourable for recruitment, whereas strong upwelling, weak upwelling and Angola Current intrusion appear detrimental to recruitment success. The SOM was used to identify characteristic patterns from sea level difference data and these were interpreted with the aid of sea surface temperature data. We found that the major oceanographic processes of upwelling and Angola Current intrusion dominated these patterns, allowing them to be partitioned into those representing recruitment favourable conditions and those representing adverse conditions for recruitment. A marginally significant relationship was found between the index of sardine recruitment and the frequency of recruitment favourable conditions (r2 = 0.61, p = 0.068, n = 6). Because larvae are vulnerable to environmental influences for a period of at least 50 days after spawning, the SOM was then used to identify windows of persistent favourable conditions lasting longer than 50 days, termed recruitment favourable periods (RFPs). The occurrence of RFPs was compared with back-calculated spawning dates for each cohort. Finally, a comparison of RFPs with the time of spawning and the index of recruitment showed that in years where there were 50 or more days of favourable conditions following spawning, good recruitment followed (Mann-Whitney U-test: p = 0.064, n = 6). These results show the value of the SOM technique for describing spatio-temporal variability in oceanographic processes. Variability in these processes appears to be an important factor influencing recruitment in the Northern Benguela sardine, although the available data time series is currently too short to be conclusive. Nonetheless, the analysis of satellite data, using a neural network pattern-recognition approach, provides a useful framework for investigating fisheries recruitment problems. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Large amplitude variations in recruitment of small pelagic fish result from interactions between a fluctuating environment and population dynamics processes such as spawning. The spatial extent and location of spawning, which is critical to the fate of eggs and larvae, can vary strongly from year to year, as a result of changing population structure and environmental conditions. Spawning habitat can be divided into 'potential spawning habitat', defined as habitat where the hydrographic conditions are suitable for spawning, 'realized spawning habitat', defined as habitat where spawning actually occurs, and 'successful spawning habitat', defined as habitat from where successful recruitment has resulted. Using biological data collected during the period 2000–2004, as well as hydrographic data, we investigate the role of environmental parameters in controlling the potential spawning habitat of anchovy and sardine in the Bay of Biscay. Anchovy potential spawning habitat appears to be primarily related to bottom temperature followed by surface temperature and mixed-layer depth, whilst surface and bottom salinity appear to play a lesser role. The possible influence of hydrographic factors on the spawning habitat of sardine seems less clear than for anchovy. Modelled relationships between anchovy and sardine spawning are used to predict potential spawning habitat from hydrodynamical simulations. The results show that the seasonal patterns in spawning are well reproduced by the model, indicating that hydrographic changes may explain a large fraction of spawning spatial dynamics. Such models may prove useful in the context of forecasting potential impacts of future environmental changes on sardine and anchovy reproductive strategy in the north-east Atlantic.},

Spawning activities of round herring were observed in similar temperature but narrower salinity ranges compared to anchovy. These species-specific temperature/ salinity characteristics reflect differences in the location and bottom depth distribution of their spawning grounds. Differential spawning strategies are also reflected in the species-specific relationships between spawning area and egg abundances.},

abstract = {Gonad and blood samples were taken from the captive female Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus between 1988 and 1989, and changes in serum levels of gonadal steroids were correlated with the annual gonadal cycle. Under captive conditions, female fish did not mature and spawn spontaneously, although oocytes developed up to the end of vitellogenic growth. Based on evidence from ovarian histology, the annual gonadal cycle of the Japanese sardine was divisible into four periods, i.e., immature (June to Octoboer), vitellogenesis (November to December), spawning (January to March), and post-spawning (April to May). The pattern of seasonal change in the gonadosomatic index (GSI) showed an inverse correlation to change in water and reflected the degree of ovarian maturity. The serum estradiol -17.beta. level increased from its lowest concentration (0.12 ng ml-1) in September to a peak (1.14 ng ml-1) in March. Serum 17.alpha.,20.beta. -dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17.alpha.,20.beta.-P) was detectable at low levels ({\textless} 0.3 ng ml-1) between October and February, but was below the assay detection limit (0.06 ng ml-1) at all other times. Testosterone was not detectable ({\textless} 0.06 ng ml-1) in the serum of any fish throughout the year. The effects of several steroids on the maturation of follicle -enclosed oocytes of sardine were examined in vitro, and 17.alpha.,20.beta.-P was found to be the most potent inducer of maturation. This suggests that post-vitellogenic oocytes of the Japanese sardine in captivity have an ability to respond to an appropriate hormonal effector and subsequently to resume meiotic maturation.},

abstract = {The present paper investigates the effect of environmental variability on the spawning dynamics of sardine, Sardina pilchardus, in the Eastern Mediterranean. To do so, variability in four different reproductive traits, i.e. reproductive activity, incidence of recent spawning, prevalence of early ovarian atresia and relative batch fecundity was tested along a gradient of habitat conditions like water temperature, chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and an index of zooplankton production. Apart from atretic prevalence all remaining traits were significantly and positively correlated with Chl a concentration which indicates that sardine in the E. Mediterranean tends to enhance egg production under conditions of increased primary productivity. On the other hand, prevalence of atresia together with spawning incidence were positively affected by water temperature whilst the only factor that correlated significantly with the index of zooplankton production was relative fecundity. These findings were interpreted as an indication of direct energy flow from phytoplankton filter-feeding to gonadal development and egg production, implying that besides capitalized energy sardine also uses current income for supporting reproduction. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A two-species population dynamics model was constructed for Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus off the Pacific coast of Japan. Japanese sardine and chub mackerel have exhibited dramatic changes in stock abundance. The simulation captures these fluctuations clearly for the period 1976-2000 using this model. This population dynamics model has three sub-models: Stock, RecruitmentOfSardine and RecruitmentOfChubMackerel. The sub-model Stock is an age-structured model which calculates the natural mortality, catch, and spawning biomass of sardine and chub mackerel, respectively. The sub-model RecruitmentOfSardine is comprised of two sub-models: a spawning model Spawning and a spatial model Ocean of the early life stages. The sub-model RecruitmentOfChubMackerel is a recruitment model which receives the spawning biomass of chub mackerel and the stock biomass of sardine from the sub-model Stock and calculates the recruitment number of chub mackerel by an extended Ricker spawner-recruit curve which incorporates the water temperature of the spawning area and the stock biomass of sardine. The initial simulations were carried out using data of the age-specific stock number (number of individuals) and the data of the individual age-specific weight of sardine and chub mackerel in 1976. As the output data of 1977-2000, yearly egg data of sardine, recruitment data of chub mackerel, stock data and catch data were obtained. In this work, using the two-species population dynamics model, we investigated the influence of the fishery and the water temperature on the biomass of the two fishes. Our simulation revealed that the simulated chub mackerel stock increased again after 1995 in the absence of catch, however, the sardine stock decreased after the late-1980s even in the absence of catch. In the case of lower water temperature, the simulated sardine stock increased and the simulated chub mackerel stock decreased. It was expected that the fluctuations of two fishes population were re-synchronized after a certain period of time by effects of the water temperature. Our simulation indicated that the water temperature could influence the different stock fluctuations of sardine and chub mackerel in the case that the initial status of these fishes were very different. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The spring bloom of phytoplankton is a well-established, regular, seasonal event in the western subarctic Pacific and is considered one of the most important conditions of massive production of pelagic fishes. A series of 12 cruises was conducted from 1990 to 1992 to examine the timing and magnitude of the spring phytoplankton bloom in the Oyashio region, the western subarctic Pacific off Hokkaido, Japan. An interannual variability in the bloom events was also analysed. On the basis of hydrographical characteristics, the study area was divided into three water masses: the Oyashio Water Mass, the Mixed Water Mass, and the Coastal Water Mass. Spring blooms were observed first in April in the Oyashio and the Coastal Water Masses, and continued to May in 1991 and 1992. However, no bloom was recorded in the Mixed Water Mass. High nutrient supply into the surface mixed layer during winter is likely to be one of the factors supporting an intense spring bloom in the Oyashio Water Mass. A significant positive relationship between log-transformed surface chlorophyll a concentration and maximum density gradient (MDG) within the euphotic layer was obtained in April, indicating the importance of vertical stability of the water column in the initiation of spring blooms in the Oyashio and the Coastal Water Masses. The spring blooms in 1991 were much more extensive and lasted longer than in 1990. It is suggested that meteorological conditions and abundance of grazers were responsible for this interannual difference.},

Variations related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation were detected for plankton biomass in both northern and southern regions, although there were regional differences with respect to mechanisms and timing. Springtime stratification increased after the late 1970s in the north, roughly coinciding with the northern Pacific regime shift in 1976/77. Stratification also increased due to warming in the south in the early 1980s, several years after the 1976/77 regime shift. Responding to the increase in stratification, springtime biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton increased in the north and decreased in the south. Principal component analysis revealed that hydrographic conditions during spring, rather than winter, determined springtime phytoplankton biomass. In northern regions, spring phytoplankton production may be enhanced by increased light availability, due to mixed layer stabilization. In the south, where background nutrient concentration within the water column was low, increases in stratification were likely to limit nutrient supply to the surface layer, resulting in decreases in phytoplankton production. A positive relationship between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass suggested bottom-up control of secondary production in northern regions. The nature of the links between phytoplankton and zooplankton production was not clear in southern regions, where hydrographic conditions during winter seemed to be responsible for variations in springtime secondary production.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that the population dynamics of distant fish stocks may be synchronized by climate variations is largely based on a few major pelagic fisheries or stocks (called here ‘target series'). We broadened the study of synchrony to all available fisheries in the world by making use of all available data in the FAO catch database during the last 50 years. We investigated synchronous patterns in remote fisheries using two different approaches. The first approach consisted of simulating catch time-series as random walk processes and comparing the synchronies found between these time-series to the synchronies found in FAO data. In the second approach, we applied classification algorithms to analyse synchronies in the FAO catch database. We used K-means clustering and neural networks to answer the following four questions: (1) Do the target series appear in the same cluster? (2) Do the clusters regroup series from the same region (local synchrony) or from distant ones (remote synchrony)? (3) Are there any numerically dominant patterns (clusters) in the catch series? (4) Do the species displaying the same pattern share some common bio-ecological features or ranges of abundance? Our results indicate some degree of local rather than remote synchrony. Nonetheless, it does not prove that such remote synchronies do not exist, but simply that further process studies are required before accepting them as a new paradigm.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The Far Eastern sardine (Sardinops sagax) began to increase$\backslash$ndramatically in the early 1970s, reached a peak in the late 1980s,$\backslash$nbut then decreased thereafter. This dramatic recovery and collapse$\backslash$nis the second cycle this century, and constitutes part of a long-term$\backslash$nstructural change in a pelagic fish community. The new cycle was$\backslash$ninitiated with higher survival at the earliest stages of sardine$\backslash$non both coasts of central Japan and they spread to the north, south$\backslash$nand offshore. Strong year classes were produced at short intervals.$\backslash$nThe spawning area moved westward and inshore. Collapse was caused$\backslash$nby survival failure. The spawning activity shifted to theeast and$\backslash$noffshore and the range of the sardine was reduced. Recovery was triggered$\backslash$nby global climatic change in a density-independent manner and the$\backslash$ncollapse underway is caused by a density-dependent mechanism. The$\backslash$nsardine is the keystone species in the pelagic fish community and$\backslash$nchanges of mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and anchovy (Engraulis japonicus)$\backslash$npopulations are in progress.},

abstract = {The connection of climate variability with anchovy spawning and recruitment in the Black Sea in partic- ular, and other ecosystems in general, was studied using a two-way coupled lower trophic level and anchovy bioenergetics model. Climate variability was represented by a 50-yr time series of daily tempera- ture and vertical mixing rates with stochastic varia- tions. Temperature was found to be the dominant factor influencing early life stages and hence popula- tion dynamics of Black Sea anchovy as marked by a high correlation of anchovy egg production and recruitment success in response to changes in temper- ature. Each decrease of 2°C in summer mean temper- atures resulted in a delay in the timing of egg production of between 12 and 19 days. Water tem- peratures in the spawning season had a greater influ- ence than the number of available spawning females on the intensity of egg production. Anchovy recruit- ment was similarly influenced by temperature, with decreased temperatures resulting in a significant delay in the onset of peak recruitment during the fall by 21–38 days. Also, recruitment numbers in December decreased by about 20{\%} with decreasing tempera- tures. The impact of temperature on production was slightly diminished by the impact of vertical mixing. The strong linkage of climate variability with anchovy spawning and recruitment has an important prediction potential for short-term anchovy stock estimations, which may serve fisheries management purposes.},

abstract = {Decadal changes in northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) diet were examined based on the stomach contents data collected off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan from January to April, 1953–1988. Seventeen families of fish and seven families of squid were identified from the stomach contents. Dominant prey species in terms of percentage of occurrence and wet weight were Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus), chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), and myctophid fishes. Demersal fishes, sparkling enope squid (Watasenia scintillans), and oceanic squids were also preyed on at low incidences. Decadal-scale diet composition of northern fur seals revealed shifts in the significance of Japanese sardine and chub mackerel in parallel with the decadal alternation in the dominance of these species within the pelagic fish community off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan. These results suggest that northern fur seals can use a variety of prey resources in this wintering area by switching the diet according to the distribution and abundance of prey species.},

abstract = {We investigated environmental effects on larval anchovy fluctuations (based on CPUE from 1980 to 2000) in the waters off southwestern Taiwan using advanced time series analyses, including the state-space approach to remove seasonality, wavelet analysis to investigate transient relationships, and stationary bootstrap to test correlation between time series. For large-scale environmental effects, we used the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) to represent the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO); for local hydrographic conditions, we used sea surface temperature (SST), river runoff, and mixing conditions. Whereas the anchovy catch consisted of a northern species (Engraulis japonicus) and two southern species (Encrasicholina heteroloba and Encrasicholina punctifer), the magnitude of the anchovy catch appeared to be mainly determined by the strength of Eng. japonicus (Japanese anchovy). The main factor that caused the interannual variation of anchovy CPUE might change through time. The CPUE showed a negative correlation with combination of water temperature and river runoff before 1987 and a positive correlation with river runoff after 1988. Whereas a significant negative correlation between CPUE and ENSOs existed, this correlation was driven completely by the low-frequency ENSO events and explained only 10{\%} of the variance. Several previous studies on this population emphasized that the fluctuations of larval anchovy abundance were determined by local SST. Our analyses indicated that such a correlation was transient and simply reflected ENSO signals. Recent advances in physical oceanography around Taiwan showed that the ENSOs reduced the strength of the Asian monsoon and thus weakened the China Coastal Current toward Taiwan. The decline of larval anchovy during ENSO may be due to reduced China Coastal Current, which is important in facilitating the spawning migration of the Japanese anchovy.},

abstract = {Variations in larval fish growth rates are largely the result of variability in biotic and abiotic characteristics of the feeding environment experienced by each individual. An assessment of an individual's overall feeding success (i.e. accumulation of utilizable organic matter) can best be achieved at the time of capture when the relationships among environment, short-term feeding success as defined by gut content and long-term feeding success as defined by accumulated growth can be contrasted. Here, we investigated the relationships between average growth, feeding success, and variability in individual growth and feeding rates across a range of taxa based on a synthesis of studies in which stomach content and otolith growth were measured in the same individuals. Instantaneous measures of feeding success were highly variable and demonstrated a positive yet somewhat limited association with growth rates across all taxa. The strength of the feeding-growth relationships among taxa, and cohorts within taxa, was reflected in the autocorrelation of individual growth rates, suggesting that stable growth was achieved through consistent feeding success. However, when viewed at the individual level, faster growth was achieved in individuals with more variable growth rates, and by inference more variable past feeding success. The dichotomy in these underlying relationships may point to the importance of stochastic events in the development of exceptional individuals in a population, and may be linked to how surplus energy is allocated to individual growth rates. The positive correlation found between feeding success and growth in all taxa is consistent with the growth-survival paradigm for the larval stage of fish. However, both the correlation between feeding success and growth and the serial correlation of growth time-series was greatest in fast-growing species, suggesting that the potential for an early "critical period" regulating survival varies among species, reaching a maximum in fast-growing fish.},

abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) and their stomach contents were examined and compared among various regions around Japan. Geographical variations in the isotope ratios were found between inshore and Pacific offshore regions. While most of the anchovy samples had isotope ratios around -17.6 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 10.0 parts per thousand for delta N-15 as median values, higher (more enriched) isotope values were found in the anchovy sampled from inshore regions. On the contrary, lower (more depleted) values were found mostly in the anchovy from the Pacific offshore region including the Kuroshio Extension and Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zones. Higher carbon isotope ratios in the inshore regions may reflect a carbon source from benthic primary producers in addition to phytoplankton possibly through the consumption of the larvae of benthic organisms such as bivalves or decapods, which were found in the stomach contents of the inshore anchovy. Variations in the nitrogen isotope ratio may reflect not only differences in the trophic level of prey species, but also variations in the baseline level of food webs. Stable isotope ratios are potentially a useful tool for understanding the stock/population structure and migration of anchovy. The present findings indicate the potential importance of the "inshore-offshore" variations in the biology of Japanese anchovy populations in the northwestern Pacific waters.},

Inter-annual fluctuations in spawning ground distributions of dab (Limanda Limanda), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), cod (Gadus morhua) and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) were investigated in the southern North Sea and eastern English Channel, from 2006 to 2009. The preferential spawning habitats of these species were modelled using generalised linear models, with egg distribution being used as proxy of spawners' location. Egg spatial and temporal distributions were explored based on six environmental variables: sea surface temperature and salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, depth, bedstress and seabed sediment types. In most cases, egg density was found to be strongly related to these environmental variables. Egg densities were positively correlated with shallow to intermediate depths having low temperature and relatively high salinity. Habitat models were used to map annual, i.e. 2006 to 2009, winter spatial distributions of eggs, for each species separately. Then, annual maps were combined to explore the spatial variability of each species' spawning grounds, and define recurrent, occasional, rare and unfavourable spawning areas. The recurrent spawning grounds of all four species were located in the south-eastern part of the study area, mainly along the Dutch and German coasts. This study contributes knowledge necessary to the spatial management of fishery resources in the area, and may also be used to identify marine areas with particular habitat features that need to be preserved. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Large amplitude variations in recruitment of small pelagic fish result from interactions between a fluctuating environment and population dynamics processes such as spawning. The spatial extent and location of spawning, which is critical to the fate of eggs and larvae, can vary strongly from year to year, as a result of changing population structure and environmental conditions. Spawning habitat can be divided into 'potential spawning habitat', defined as habitat where the hydrographic conditions are suitable for spawning, 'realized spawning habitat', defined as habitat where spawning actually occurs, and 'successful spawning habitat', defined as habitat from where successful recruitment has resulted. Using biological data collected during the period 2000–2004, as well as hydrographic data, we investigate the role of environmental parameters in controlling the potential spawning habitat of anchovy and sardine in the Bay of Biscay. Anchovy potential spawning habitat appears to be primarily related to bottom temperature followed by surface temperature and mixed-layer depth, whilst surface and bottom salinity appear to play a lesser role. The possible influence of hydrographic factors on the spawning habitat of sardine seems less clear than for anchovy. Modelled relationships between anchovy and sardine spawning are used to predict potential spawning habitat from hydrodynamical simulations. The results show that the seasonal patterns in spawning are well reproduced by the model, indicating that hydrographic changes may explain a large fraction of spawning spatial dynamics. Such models may prove useful in the context of forecasting potential impacts of future environmental changes on sardine and anchovy reproductive strategy in the north-east Atlantic.},

Consequently, little is known concerning potential interactions among these three species in this region. Based upon parallel cruises conducted in June/July 2005, we compared the larval abundance, size-distributions and biochemical-based condition of these species among 1) nearshore (Wadden Sea) areas and offshore (German Bight) areas that were 2) vertically mixed, 3) frontal zones, or 4) stratified waters. In general terms, larval condition (RNA:DNA) was relatively high at all stations. Although fronts clearly acted to concentrate larvae, larval condition was not necessarily higher. For example 9{\%} of sardines captured at the tidal mixing front were categorised as starving, while no starving larvae were sampled in the stratified water masses. Habitats of sardine and sprat larvae were similar, whereas anchovies were primarily restricted to nearshore areas. This is the first Study examining the potential role of near- and offshore habitats as nursery areas and the extent to which resource (habitat) partitioning exists among the larvae of sprat and newly established anchovy and sardine in the North Sea.},

abstract = {Mummichog, a spring and summer spawning teleost, were exposed to various photoperiod and temperature conditions to investigate the environmental regulation of the annual reproductive cycle. In early spring, latter phases of gonadal development (vitellogenesis in females and active spermatogenesis in males) were effectively accelerated by warm temperature (16°C) regardless of the photoperiod (11L or 16L), although internal factor(s) may be concerned with triggering the initiation of the development. In late summer, intense gonadal regression which leads to the termination of the spawning period was accelerated by a short day length (≤13L) in both yearlings and underyearlings. In underyearlings, however high water temperature and internal factor(s) may also be concerned. In early autumn, early phases of gonadal development (growth of cortical alveolus stage oocytes in females and basal spermatogenesis in males) were induced by moderate or lower temperatures (≤22°C) even under a short day length (11L). From the middle of autumn to early winter, this fish is probably in the "refractory period," and did not progress to the latter phases even under adequate temperature and long day length conditions (22°C-16L). Mummichog showed a probable circa-annual rhythm of gonadal activity under constant temperature and photoperiod conditions (22°C-16L): this rhythm may be the basis of the trigger of the gonadal development prior to the spawning period, the termination of the spawning period in underyearlings, and the occurrence of the "refractory period" during autumn. Plasma concentrations of estradiol-17$\beta$ in females and testosterone in males correlated well with the gonadal development during early spring and the regression during late summer. However, there was no correlation between plasma steroid levels and the degree of progress during the early phases of gonadal development in autumn, suggesting other factor such as direct action of GtH(s) or mediating substance other than sex steroids for these phases. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

In spite of considerable research effort over several decades there has been no significant improvement in identifying clear causal mechanisms of recruitment in marine fish stocks. Starvation has not been demonstrated to be a primary mechanism controlling survival of fish larvae. Studies matching food levels and year-class strength continue to provide indirect evidence that growth during the first year of life is dependent on food supply and may be important in determining survival. The hypothesis that survival is a direct function of growth provides a rational theoretical framework for recruitment research and is suggested as a basis for future work. Growth rate must be studied as a function of both ration and temperature. Studies examining the relationship of growth rate to survival should be specific to each life history stage and ideally integrated throughout the pre-recruit period. It remains to be demonstrated that survival is a direct function of growth, mediated through size-dependent predation.},

abstract = {Transport of Pacific saury Cololabis saira larvae from spawning to nursery grounds was examined based on datasets from larval distribution surveys during winter seasons 1990-2011. In the surveys, a neuston net was towed for 10 min over broad areas off the southern Pacific coast of Japan. Transport trajectories of saury larvae and temperature they experienced were analyzed based on a numerical particle-tracking model from 1993 to 2011 using satellite-based sea surface current and temperature data. Larval growth during the transport was estimated from the relationship of larval growth to environmental factors obtained in a previous study. Results of the particle tracking experiments indicated that a large amount of saury juveniles (knob length, KnL, 40 mm) were transported to an area south of the Kuroshio axis. Only a relatively small amount (14.6{\%}) of the 40 mm KnL stage juveniles were transported in and around the Kuroshio extension, although it has previously been considered important that the juveniles are transported to the area north of the Kuroshio extension. Abundance of juveniles transported to the area north of the Kuroshio extension indicated a positive relationship to the abundance of medium size class saury in the autumn fishing season. Even though a very small part (3.9{\%}) of hatched larvae were transported to this area, recruitment of the saury population depends on this amount of transported hatched larvae. On the other hand, the high juvenile transport rate to the areas south of the Kuroshio axis may suggest a broad dispersal mechanism to ensure that some larvae find a suitable habitat. Subsequently, the importance of saury in the marine ecosystem as a food item for predatory species in the sub-tropical region is discussed.},

Duration of peak spawning season was highly correlated (p {\textless} 0.01) with larval food abundance in the field (copepod nauplii + copepodite and adult cyclopoids + copepodite calanoids), but not correlated with salinity or temperature. Cohort mortality rates determined throughout the spawning season were lower in the middle of the peak spawning season (when food availability was maximum) and higher at the beginning and end of the spawning season. Since the duration of the high microzooplankton abundance is so short (4 to 5 wk) and because of the high energy requirements of young bay anchovy, it is proposed that adult bay anchovy spawn during the season of maximum food availability thus enhancing offspring survival},

abstract = {Abstract Avian clutch size has been reported to show a poleward increase, a pattern that is well supported in landbirds but less so in waterbirds. We analyzed geographic variation in clutch and brood size among seven species of Nearctic herons and egrets (Ardeidae) over a latitudinal range spanning from 25° to 52°N. We included in the analysis data from 71 published references that reported information on both clutch and brood size. We found a strong and coherent latitudinal increase in clutch size in all species, but no unequivocal latitudinal variation in brood size. This resulted in a decreased index of productivity (brood size:clutch size ratio, excluding nest failures) with increasing latitude. In addition, we detected habitat-related variation in clutch size, which was, on average, smaller in salt-water than in freshwater habitats. The latitudinal decrease of the productivity index, which was not associated with latitudinal variation in nest-failure rates at either the clutch or brood stage, contrasts with previously proposed explanations for gradients in clutch size, which invoke latitudinal differences in seasonal variation of food abundance or nest-predation intensity. We suggest that factors other than those proposed in the case of landbirds may explain the latitudinal variation in clutch size in herons. In any case, our results suggest that herons may pay higher reproductive costs to obtain similar benefits when breeding at higher latitudes.},

abstract = {Patterns of phenotypic change across environmental gradients (e.g., latitude, altitude) have long captivated the interest of evolutionary ecologists. The pattern and magnitude of phenotypic change is determined by the covariance between genetic and environmental influences across a gradient. Cogradient variation (CoGV) occurs when covariance is positive: that is, genetic and environmental influences on phenotypic expression are aligned and their joint influence accentuates the change in mean trait value across the gradient. Conversely, countergradient variation (CnGV) occurs when covariance is negative: that is, genetic and environmental influences on phenotypes oppose one another, thereby diminishing the change in mean trait expression across the gradient. CnGV has so far been found in at least 60 species, with most examples coming from fishes, amphibians, and insects across latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. Traits that display CnGV most often involve metabolic compensation, that is, the elevation of various physiological rates processes (development, growth, feeding, metabolism, activity) to counteract the dampening effect of reduced temperature, growing season length, or food supply. Far fewer examples of CoGV have been identified (11 species), and these most often involve morphological characters. Increased knowledge of spatial covariance patterns has furthered our understanding of Bergmann size clines, phenotypic plasticity, species range limits, tradeoffs in juvenile growth rate, and the design of conservation strategies for wild species. Moreover, temporal CnGV explains some cases of an apparent lack of phenotypic response to directional selection and provides a framework for predicting evolutionary responses to climate change. },

abstract = {Theoretical treatments of egg size in fishes suggest that constraints on reproductive output should create trade-offs between the size and number of eggs produced per spawn. For marine reef fishes, the observation of distinct reproductive care strategies (demersal guarding, egg scattering, and pelagic spawning) has additionally prompted speculation that these strategies reflect alternative fitness optima with selection on egg size differing by reproductive mode and perhaps latitude. Here, we aggregate data from 278 reef fish species and test whether clutch size, reproductive care, adult body size, and latitudinal bands (i.e., tropical, subtropical, and temperate) predict egg size, using a statistically unified framework that accounts for phylogenetic correlations among traits. We find no inverse relationship between species egg size and clutch size, but rather that egg size differs by reproductive mode (mean volume for demersal eggs = 1.22 mm3, scattered eggs = 0.18 mm3, pelagic eggs = 0.52 mm3) and that clutch size is strongly correlated with adult body size. Larger eggs were found in temperate species compared with tropical species in both demersal guarders and pelagic spawners, but this difference was not strong when accounting for phylogenetic correlations, suggesting that differences in species composition underlies regional differences in egg size. In summary, demersal guarders are generally small fishes with small clutch sizes that produce large eggs. Pelagic spawners and egg scatterers are variable in adult and clutch size. Although pelagic spawned eggs are variable in size, those of scatterers are consistently small.},

We compared body shape between two populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Striking shape differences occurred between juveniles from the two populations when reared in a common laboratory environment. However, no difference in body shape occurred between wild-reared juveniles from the two populations, suggesting that the genetic differences between populations were obscured by opposing effects of the environmental differences experienced in the wild. We suggest that much of the genetic diversity in body shape of fishes may be cryptic, with stabilizing selection for the same optimal phenotype resulting in genetic divergence between populations subject to contrasting environmental influences.},

abstract = {Length growth in relation to water temperature was studied for Crangon crangon (L.) from two populations at the northern and southern edges of its distributional range to determine whether counter-gradient growth compensation occurs. In crustaceans, growth rate depends on the time between moulting events (intermoult period) and the size increase at moult (moult increment). In this study, the period between moults was shorter at higher temperature, ranging respectively from about 11 days at 25 °C to 27 days at 10 °C at southern edge, and from 10 to 24 days at the same temperatures at the northern edge. Moult increment showed a large variability, from 1.5 to 2.7 mm with no clear trend with temperature at the northern edge; and decreasing from about 2.7 mm at 10 °C to about 1.5 mm at 25 °C at the southern edge. As a result, the temperature effect on the overall growth rate differed between shrimps from the north and those from the south, suggesting counter-gradient growth compensation. At the northern edge, mean growth increased from about 0.12 mm d−1 at 10 °C to about 0.23 mm d−1 at 25 °C, while at the southern edge, growth was lower, about 0.08 mm d−1 at 10 °C and increased to about 0.16 mm d−1 at 25 °C. Maximum observed growth rates of shrimps from the north were also higher and ranged from 0.17 mm d−1 at 10 °C to 0.89 mm d−1 at 25 °C, while shrimps from the south grew at a maximum of 0.08 to 0.75 mm d−1 respectively at 15 and 20 °C. Sex and size differences were also found, with males growing slower than females and at a decreasing growth rate with increasing size. Implications for the brown shrimp's life cycle are discussed.},

abstract = {1. Energetics of reproduction in birds is reviewed with the question in mind how the parent adjusts its effort in relation to prevailing environmental conditions in order to maximize the output of young in its lifetime. Emphasis is on proximate controls, rather than ultimate factors measurable in terms of adult survival and recruitment of young. 2. The decision to breed or not to breed is clearly related to body condition of the female, presumably because of the implications this has for survival. 3. Laying date and clutch size are likewise under the influence of female condition and can hence be modified by experiments involving supplementary feeding. Natural variation in these features may often be related to territory quality. 4. How the bird decides whether or not to commence a second brood is not clear, but in the Great Tit the habitat-related difference in incidence of second broods is functionally understandable when survival probabilities of birds at different times are considered. 5. A distinction is made between a "capital" and "income" model for translatting rates of change of female body condition into appropriate decisions on laying date and clutch size and experiments are suggested that discriminate between the two. 6. Lack's view that brood size is in an evolutionary sense adjusted in order to balance food requirement and foraging capacity of the parents is accepted, and growth rates in nidicolous birds are analysed to ascertain if a finer adjustment exists superimposed on the integer steps of brood adjustment. Critical for this analysis are groups of birds where broods of one are common, since only in these circumstances is growth adjustment the only strategy open to the parents. In common with other animals, growth rate is related to mature body size but within a category of adult weight clear examples can be found for retardation of growth rate in pelecaniform and charadriiform species with singleton broods. 7. Since daily energy requirement is related to nestling size and growth rate, retardation of growth is explicable as a strategy only in terms of reducing the daily commitment of the parents, not reducing the total cost of producing a nestling. 8. An additional economy in growth is to reduce the contribution of fat to the nestling body. 9. Implied in Lack's view of brood size is a limitation of parental foraging capacity, and the last section of the paper is devoted to exploration of the proximate factors delimiting what Royama terms the optimal working capacity of parents feeding young. Observations of parent starlings confronted with manipulated brood size suggest a limit on the time that can be devoted to energetically extravagant flight activity, rather than a shortage of absolute time. Beyond the limit to which stressed parents can be made to fly, body weight declines. 10. Preliminary data on energy metabolized daily by parents confronted with large broods conforms to the simplified view that parental effort on a sustained basis equates to energy mobilization equivalent to 4 B.M.R. units and it is suggested that this level of energy expenditure represents a proximal decision substrate for determining the optimal working capacity of the parent. 11. The paper ends with a plea for more research on the proximate controls of avian reproduction, and calls attention to the central importance of the protein bank to parental body condition.},

abstract = {Environmental conditions during the larval phase (food concentration and temperature) impact recruitment success of marine bivalves by affecting growth and survival. We analysed the seasonal match between environmental conditions and larval presence of six coastal bivalve species over eight consecutive years (2006-2013) in the western Wadden Sea, taking species-specific physiological responses to these conditions into account. The larval occurrence of four species overlapped with their optimum in environmental conditions as calculated following the Dynamic Energy Budget theory: the occurrence of larvae of Cerastoderma edule, Mya arenaria and Mytilus edulis matched with their optimum food conditions, while larvae of Crassostrea gigas were mainly found during the temperature optimum of this species. Larvae of Ensis directus and Macoma balthica, however, only occurred months after their most favourable food conditions. The first group probably uses the energy immediately after uptake for the production and release of gametes ('income breeders'), whereas the second group accumulates and stores energy reserves for later reproduction ('capital breeders'). Larvae of C. gigas and M. balthica were observed much earlier in the year than expected from previous occurrences and from formerly know threshold temperatures for spawning. These apparent changes in timing of spawning suggest that Pacific oysters and Baltic tellins have recently acclimated to new environmental conditions.},

abstract = {For some species, climate change has altered environmental conditions away from those in which life-history strategies evolved. In such cases, if adaptation does not keep pace with these changes, existing life-history strategies may become maladaptive and lead to population declines. We use life-history theory, with a specific emphasis on breeding strategies, in the context of the trophic match–mismatch framework to form generalizable hypotheses about population-level consumer responses to climate-driven perturbations in resource availability. We first characterize the income and breeding traits of sympatric caribou and muskoxen populations in wes- tern Greenland, and then test trait-based hypotheses about the expected reproductive performance of each population during a period of high resource variability at that site. The immediate reproductive performance of income breeding caribou decreased with trophic mismatch. In contrast, capital breeding muskoxen were relatively unaffected by current breed- ing season resource variability, but their reproductive performance was sensitive to resource conditions from previous years. These responses matched our expectations about how capital and income breeding strategies should influence population susceptibility to phenological mismatch. We argue for a taxon-independent assessment of trophic mismatch vulnerability based on a life-history strategy perspective in the context of prevailing environmental conditions},

abstract = {Behaviour and life-history strategies of zooplankton have evolved in response to seasonal cycles in food availability, predation risk and abiotic conditions. A key challenge is to understand how different activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production, influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migra- tion? Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii) predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of seasonal resolution, state-dependent pro- cesses and individual variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies.},

abstract = {The sapphire devil, Chrysiptera cyanea, is a reef-associated damselfish and their ovarian development can be induced by a long photoperiod. In this study, we demonstrated the existence of a photoinducible phase for the photoperiodic ovarian development in the sapphire devil. Induction of ovarian development under night-interruption light schedules and Nanda-Hamner cycles revealed that the photoinducible phase appeared in a circadian manner between ZT12 and ZT13. To characterize the effect of photoperiod on clock gene expression in the brain of this species, we determined the expression levels of the sdPer1, sdPer2, sdCry1, and sdCry2 clock genes under constant light and dark conditions (LL and DD) and photoperiodic (short and long photoperiods). The expression of sdPer1 exhibited clear circadian oscillation under both LL and DD conditions, while sdPer2 and sdCry1 expression levels were lower under DD than under LL conditions and sdCry2 expression was lower under LL than under DD conditions. These results suggest a key role for sdPer1 in circadian clock cycling and that sdPer2, sdCry1, and sdCry2 are light-responsive clock genes in the sapphire devil. After 1. week under a long photoperiod, we observed photoperiod-related changes in sdPer1, sdPer2, and sdCry2 expression, but not in sdCry1 expression. These results suggest that the expression patterns of some clock genes exhibit seasonal variation according to seasonal changes in day length and that such seasonal alteration of clock gene expression may contribute to seasonal recognition by the sapphire devil.},

abstract = {Lunar cycle-associated physiology has been found in a wide variety of organisms. Recent study has revealed that mRNA levels of Cryptochrome ( Cry ), one of the circadian clock genes, were significantly higher on a full moon night than on a new moon night in coral, implying the involvement of a photoreception system in the lunar-synchronized spawning. To better establish the generalities surrounding such a mechanism and explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we focused on the relationship between lunar phase, Cry gene expression, and the spawning behavior in a lunar-synchronized spawner, the goldlined spinefoot ( Siganus guttatus ), and we identified two kinds of Cry genes in this animal. Their mRNA levels showed lunar cycle-dependent expression in the medial part of the brain (mesencephalon and diencephalon) peaking at the first quarter moon. Since this lunar phase coincided with the reproductive phase of the goldlined spinefoot, Cry gene expression was considered a state variable in the lunar phase recognition system. Based on the expression profiles of SgCry s together with the moonlight's pattern of timing and duration during its nightly lunar cycle, we have further speculated on a model of lunar phase recognition for reproductive control in the goldlined spinefoot, which integrates both moonlight and circadian signals in a manner similar to photoperiodic response.},

In the first half of the 20th century, large amounts of spawning herring were caught by set nets at coastal spawning grounds off the coast of Hokkaido, Japan. Using the catch data, we analyzed the mean length at age with respect to sea-surface temperature and density-dependent growth during the years 1910 to 1954 by generalized additive modeling (GAM). This stock is distributed at the southern boundary of the distribution range of Pacific herring, and we thus hypothesized that high temperatures have a negative effect on growth. Our study shows that length of Hokkaido spring spawning herring is highly dependent on growth during the first years of life and on temperatures preceding and during the feeding season. Higher temperatures during winter have a negative effect on growth. We found only weak indications of density-dependent growth in the stock of Hokkaido spring spawning herring.},

However, little information exists on the temperature-mortality relationship in Vietnam.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: This article aims to examine the monthly temperature-mortality relationship among older people in Hanoi, Vietnam, over the period between 2005 and 2010, and estimate seasonal patterns in mortality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We employed Generalized Additive Models, including smooth functions, to model the temperature-mortality relationships. A quasi-Poisson distribution was used to model overdispersion of death counts. Temporal trends, seasonality, and population size were adjusted for while estimating changes in monthly mortality over the study period. A cold month was defined as a month with a mean temperature below 19°C.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This study found that the high peak of mortality coincided with low temperatures in the month of February 2008, during which the mean temperature was the lowest in the whole study period. There was a significant relationship between mean monthly temperature and mortality among the older people (p{\textless}0.01). Overall, there was a significant decrease in the number of deaths in the year 2009 during the study period. There was a 21{\%} increase in the number of deaths during the cold season compared to the warm season. The increase in mortality during the cold period was higher among females compared to males (female: IRR [incidence relative risk] =1.23; male: IRR=1.18).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Cold temperatures substantially increased mortality among the older population in Hanoi, Vietnam, and there were gender differences. Necessary preventive measures are required to mitigate temperature effects with greater attention to vulnerable groups.},

Daily batch fecundities were directly related to female size and ranged from 514 to 2026 ova. Mean relative fecundities did not differ between years (mean = 687 ova g-1). Age-1 females produced 99.6 and 92.8 {\%} of the eggs spawned in July of 1986 and 1987, respectively. Females in the 50 to 55 mm length range contributed 53 and 57 {\%} of the eggs spawned in 1986 and 1987. No young-of-the-year anchovy, 35 to 42 mm fork length, that were examined were mature. Most recruited young-of-the-year anchovy collected in September and October were hatched in July. Peak hatching occurred in early July 1987 but occurred from mid- to late July in 1986. The earlier 1987 hatch dates may have resulted from earlier spawning in response to higher water temperatures.

abstract = {American shad Alosa sapidissima in semelparous and iteroparous populations along its native range are thought to have nearly equivalent lifetime reproductive output due to reciprocal latitudinal trends in fecundity and degree of repeat spawning. Geographic differences in reproductive patterns are believed to be linked to varying environmental conditions, and this fine tuning is considered strong evidence of intraspecific life history evolution in marine fishes. American shad are also multiple or batch spawners, but this reproductive trait has only recently been described. Our objectives were to estimate batch fecundity of American shad in semelparous (St. Johns River, Florida) and iteroparous stocks (York River, Virginia, and Connecticut River, Massachusetts) and to re-evaluate annual and lifetime fecundity in these populations. Hydrated females were collected on the spawning grounds of each river. Hydrated oocytes were counted in subsamples from each ovary, and batch fecundity was estimated gravimetrically. Estimates of hydrated oocytes/g ovary were found to be independent of subsample location in the gonad. Log10 -transformed relationships of batch size and total fish weight were highly significant for females in the St. Johns and York rivers and marginally significant for Connecticut River fish. Adjusting for body size, we found no significant differences in batch size among these stocks. We conclude that batch fecundity of American shad does not vary significantly among semelparous (St. Johns River) and iteroparous (York and Connecticut rivers) populations. In all stocks of American shad, spawning frequency and duration are unknown, and seasonal or lifetime egg production cannot be estimated. Thus, hypotheses portraying latitudinal variation in fecundity as an evolutionary response to decreased levels of iteroparity in stocks of American shad are unconfirmed.},

Nonparametric regression with zero-inflated data may be studied via the zero-inflated gen- eralized additive model (ZIGAM), which assumes that the zero-inflated responses come from a probabilistic mixture of zero and a regular component whose distribution belongs to the 1-parameter exponential family. With the further assumption that the probability of non-zero-inflation is some monotonic function of the mean of the regular component, we propose the constrained zero-inflated generalized additive model (COZIGAM) for an- alyzing zero-inflated data. When the hypothesized constraint obtains, the new approach provides a unified framework for modeling zero-inflated data, which is more parsimonious and efficient than the unconstrained ZIGAM.We have developed an R package COZIGAM which contains functions that implement an iterative algorithm for fitting ZIGAMs and COZIGAMs to zero-inflated data based on the penalized likelihood approach. Other functions included in the package are useful for model prediction and model selection. We demonstrate the use of the COZIGAM package via some simulation studies and a real application.},

Yet, this assumption remains conspicuously untested by broad experiments that alter environmental risk of nest predation, despite the fact that nest predation is a major source of reproductive failure. Here, we examined whether parents can assess experimentally reduced nest predation risk and alter their reproductive strategies. We experimentally reduced nest predation risk and show that in safer environments parents increased investment in young through increased egg size, clutch mass, and the rate they fed nestlings. Parents also increased investment in female condition by increasing the rates that males fed incubating females at the nest, and decreasing the time that females spent incubating. These results demonstrate that birds can assess nest predation risk at large and that nest predation plays a key role in the expression of avian reproductive strategies.},

abstract = {Many populations are composed of a mixture of individuals that reproduce at different times, and these times are often heritable. Under these conditions, gene flow should be limited between early and late reproducers, even within populations having a unimodal temporal distribution of reproductive activity. This temporal restriction on gene flow might be called 'isolation by time' (IBT) to acknowledge its analogy with isolation by distance (IBD). IBD and IBT are not exactly equivalent, however, owing to differences between dispersal in space and dispersal in time. We review empirical studies of natural populations that provide evidence for IBT based on heritabilities of reproductive time and on molecular genetic differences associated with reproductive time. When IBT is present, variation in selection through the reproductive season may lead to adaptive temporal variation in phenotypic traits [adaptation by time (ABT)]. We introduce a novel theoretical model that shows how ABT increases as (i) selection on the trait increases; (ii) environmental influences on reproductive time decrease; (iii) the heritability of reproductive time increases; and (iv) the temporal distribution of reproductive activity becomes increasingly uniform. We then review empirical studies of natural populations that provide evidence for ABT by documenting adaptive temporal clines in phenotypic traits. The best evidence for IBT and ABT currently comes from salmonid fishes and flowering plants, but we expect that future work will show these processes are more widespread.},

abstract = {Evidence has accumulated in recent decades on the drastic impact of climate change on biodiversity. Warming temperatures have induced changes in species physiology, phenology, and have decreased body size. Such modifications can impact population dynamics and could lead to changes in life cycle and demography. More specifically, conceptual frameworks predict that global warming will severely threaten tropical ectotherms while temperate ectotherms should resist or even benefit from higher temperatures. However, experimental studies measuring the impacts of future warming trends on temperate ectotherms' life cycle and population persistence are lacking. Here we investigate the impacts of future climates on a model vertebrate ectotherm species using a large-scale warming experiment. We manipulated climatic conditions in 18 seminatural populations over two years to obtain a present climate treatment and a warm climate treatment matching IPCC predictions for future climate. Warmer temperatures caused a faster body growth, an earlier reproductive onset, and an increased voltinism, leading to a highly accelerated life cycle but also to a decrease in adult survival. A matrix population model predicts that warm climate populations in our experiment should go extinct in around 20 y. Comparing our experimental climatic conditions to conditions encountered by populations across Europe, we suggest that warming climates should threaten a significant number of populations at the southern range of the distribution. Our findings stress the importance of experimental approaches on the entire life cycle to more accurately predict population and species persistence in future climates.},

abstract = {In recent years, fisheries management has succeeded in stabilizing and even improving the state of many global fisheries resources [1-5]. This is particularly evident in areas where stocks are exploited in compliance with scientific advice and strong institutional structures are in place [1, 5]. In Europe, the well-managed northeast (NE) Atlantic fish stocks have been recovering in response to decreasing fishing pressure over the past decade [3-6], albeit with a long way to go for a universal stock rebuild [3, 7]. Meanwhile, little is known about the temporal development of the European Mediterranean stocks, whose management relies on input controls that are often poorly enforced. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of 42 European Mediterranean stocks of nine species in 1990-2010, showing that exploitation rate has been steadily increasing, selectivity (proportional exploitation of juveniles) has been deteriorating, and stocks have been shrinking. We implement species-specific simulation models to quantify changes in exploitation rate and selectivity that would maximize long-term yields and halt stock depletion. We show that stocks would be more resilient to fishing and produce higher long-term yields if harvested a few years after maturation because current selectivity is far from optimal, especially for demersal stocks. The European Common Fisheries Policy that has assisted in improving the state of NE Atlantic fish stocks in the past 10 years has failed to deliver similar results for Mediterranean stocks managed under the same policy. Limiting juvenile exploitation, advancing management plans, and strengthening compliance, control, and enforcement could promote fisheries sustainability in the Mediterranean. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This work presents, for the first time, a comparative study of the feeding ecology of the most abundant pelagic fish (PF) species (sardines, anchovies, chub mackerel, horse mackerel, bogue, jack mackerel, Mediterranean horse mackerel) in the Western Iberian Upwelling Ecosystem (WIUE). Special attention is given to understanding how the trophic ecology of PF can affect sardine population dynamics, which have been declining in recent years. Diet composition was estimated for juvenile and adult fish collected off the western and southern Iberian coasts during spring by determining the contribution of different prey types and prey size-classes to total dietary carbon. Results show that PF have highly diversified diets, with mesozooplankton and prey ranging from 1000 to 2000 $\mu$m being the major contributors to total dietary carbon. Calanoid copepods were important prey for all PF. Despite these similarities, there were significant differences in diet composition between areas, species, and maturity stages. Small prey such as phytoplankton, crustacean eggs, nauplii and small copepods were particularly important for the diet of sardines and juvenile chub mackerel. Prey {\textgreater}1500 $\mu$m (including decapod larvae, euphausiids and mysids) were mostly important for anchovies, adult chub mackerel, bogue, horse mackerel, jack mackerel and Mediterranean horse mackerel. Chub mackerel juveniles had the highest diet overlap with sardines. Sardine and chub mackerel juveniles, followed by bogue, were the main predators of fish eggs, particularly those of sardines, suggesting further investigation of their role in egg mortality and recruitment strength. This is particularly relevant given the recent northward expansion of chub mackerel into the main spawning grounds of sardines off the WIUE.},

abstract = {The European anchovy fishery in the Gulf of C{\'{a}}diz (ICES Division IXa South) is largely influenced by age-0 individuals. Knowledge of young of the year growth dynamics is crucial for management, yet data on daily growth are lacking in the area. Linking growth patterns to the environment requires information on habitat occupancy through ontogeny of the fish that reach the fishery, as anchovy use different areas of the Gulf and the Guadalquivir Estuary through development. We describe the growth dynamics of age-0 anchovy through otolith microstructure analysis, and couple these data with data on microchemical signals in the otoliths to shed light into habitat use and growth dynamics in the area. Age-0 anchovy captured in September, 2011 in the Gulf ranged from 3 to 6 months old for similar sizes, with average growth rates varying twofold. Individual non-linear growth curves showed that maximum otolith growth was positively correlated with the date of spawning, which in turn was negatively correlated with the time to reach maximum growth. There was no correlation between growth parameters and body length or condition (Fulton K) at capture. The strontium:calcium (Sr/Ca) and magnesium:calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios were significantly lower at the edge of the otolith (approximately the age of capture) than at ages corresponding to larval and early juveniles ({\textless}60 days old), but values fell within typical estuarine-dwelling species. The barium:calcium ratio (Ba/Ca) increased significantly in the edge of the otolith, which possibly resulted from residency in highly productive coastal waters or from ontogenetic effects. The variance in otolith elemental ratios was larger at otolith back-calculated ages around 50 days old, age which coincides with the presumed closer dependence of estuarine waters. Our data are a first step towards understanding the contribution of the estuarine system to the fishery of anchovy in the Gulf. The limitations of the approach and future steps are discussed.

abstract = {Climate change has prompted an earlier arrival of spring in numerous ecosystems. It is uncertain whether such changes are occurring in Eastern Boundary Current Upwelling ecosystems, because these regions are subject to natural decadal climate variability, and regional climate models predict seasonal delays in upwelling. To answer this question, the phenology of 43 species of larval fishes was investigated between 1951 and 2008 off southern California. Ordination of the fish community showed earlier phenological progression in more recent years. Thirty-nine percent of seasonal peaks in larval abundance occurred earlier in the year, whereas 18{\%} were delayed. The species whose phenology became earlier were characterized by an offshore, pelagic distribution, whereas species with delayed phenology were more likely to reside in coastal, demersal habitats. Phenological changes were more closely associated with a trend toward earlier warming of surface waters rather than decadal climate cycles, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Species with long-term advances and delays in phenology reacted similarly to warming at the interannual time scale as demonstrated by responses to the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation. The trend toward earlier spawning was correlated with changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and mesozooplankton displacement volume, but not coastal upwelling. SST and upwelling were correlated with delays in fish phenology. For species with 20th century advances in phenology, future projections indicate that current trends will continue unabated. The fate of species with delayed phenology is less clear due to differences between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models in projected upwelling trends.},

For each of seven years (2003-2009), we initialize the SEIBM with the real positions of anchovy eggs during the spawning peak, from an acoustics-derived eggs production model. We analyze the effect of spawners' distribution, timing of spawning, and oceanographic conditions on the connectivity patterns, growth, dispersal distance and late-larval recruitment (14 mm larva recruits, R14) patterns. The area of influence of the Rh??ne river plume was identified as having a high probability of larval recruitment success (64{\%}), but up to 36{\%} of R14 larvae end up in the Catalan Coast. We demonstrate that the spatial paths of larvae differ dramatically from year to year, and suggest potential offshore nursery grounds. We showed that our simulations are coherent with existing recruitment proxies and therefore open new possibilities for fisheries management.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the impact of climate change on egg and larval transport of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) off Kyushu Island western Japan, we conducted particle-tracking simulations on transport success/failure to fishing grounds from 1960 to 2007. The modeled transport success since the mid-1990s increased and decreased in the offshore and coastal zones, respectively, compared with the 1960s and 1970s. The estimated northward shift of the spawning ground and weakened Tsushima Warm Current contributed to increase in modeled transport success to the offshore zone. Conversely, the weakening trend of the modeled onshore current in the Goto-Nada Sea combined with the northward shift of the spawning ground resulted in unsuccessful larval transport. These results suggest that fluctuations in juvenile and subadult anchovy catches in this area may be attributable to changes in the physical environment. The present study showed that changes in transport success induced by oceanographic fluctuations related to climate change, have the potential to affect anchovy recruitment off the western coast of Japan. {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Small pelagic fish can play an important role in various ecosystems linking lower and upper trophic levels. Among the factor behind the observed inter-annual variations in small pelagic fish abundance, intra- and inter- specific trophic interactions could have a strong impact on the recruitment variability (e.g. anchovy). Egg cannibalism observed in anchovies has been postulated to be a mecha- nism that determines the upper limit of the population density and self-regulates the population abundance of the species. On the other hand, predation by other guild spe- cies is commonly considered as a regulation mechanism between competing species. This study provides empirical evidence of anchovy cannibalism and predation of the main small pelagic fish species on anchovy eggs and estimates the effect of intraguild predation on the anchovy egg mor- tality rate. Results show that, depending on the year (2008– 2009), up to 33 {\%} of the total anchovy egg mortality was the result of sardine predation and up to 4 {\%} was the result of egg cannibalism together with predation by Atlantic and Atlantic Chub mackerel and sprat. Results also indicate that in the Bay of Biscay, fluctuations in the survival index of the early life stages of anchovy are likely to be attributable at least in part to egg cannibalism and especially to a high sardine predation on anchovy eggs.},

abstract = {In order to understand better the recruitment variability in European anchovy in the Bay of Biscay, it is important to investigate the processes that affect survival during the early life stages. Anchovy juvenile growth trajectories and hatch-date distributions were inferred over a 3-year period based on otolith microstructure analysis. Otolith growth trajectories showed a characteristic shape depending on their hatch-date timing. Earlier-born juveniles had notably broader maximum increments than later born conspecifics, resulting in higher growth rates. This observation suggests that early hatching would be beneficial for larval and juvenile growth, and, therefore, survival. The estimated juvenile hatch-date distributions were relatively narrow compared with the extended anchovy spawning season (March-August) in the Bay of Biscay and indicated that only individuals originated mainly from the summer months (June-August) survived until autumn. Hatch-date distributions were markedly different among years and seemed to influence the interannual recruitment strength of anchovy. We conclude that years characterized by juvenile survivors originating from the peak spawning period (May and June) would lead to considerable recruitment success. Downwelling events during the peak spawning period seem to affect larval survival. Furthermore, size-dependent overwinter mortality would be an additional process that regulates recruitment strength in the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay.},

abstract = {New estimates of abundance of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) are developed from California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) data on egg and larval densities for the period 1951-2011. Previous estimates utilizing mean density over the CalCOFI area show a hyperstability bias because of the nearshore concentration of CalCOFI stations and the tendency of the anchovy population to contract into this area when abundances are low. New abundance estimates weight sample egg and larval densities to the local area represented by that sample, and then sum contributions to obtain total abundance. We develop total egg and larval abundance estimates for January and April, form a combined index, and calibrate it to the absolute biomass estimates produced by the Daily Egg Production Method in the early 1980s. Anchovy spawning biomass was very low, 10,000-20,000 Metric Tons (MT), in the early 1950s when CalCOFI sampling began. Abundance increased and fluctuated between 0.5 and 2 million metric tons from 1960 through 1990. After 1990, spawning biomass fluctuated around 200,000 tons, briefly increased during 2005-2006, then declined substantially over four years to below 20,000 tons from 2009 to 2011. CalCOFI ichthyoplankton data collected after 2011 are not yet available for analysis, but continuous underway egg sampling conducted during CalCOFI cruises indicates continued low abundance and very limited spawning through 2015 in both southern and central California. The recent collapse of anchovy abundance occurred in the absence of a significant fishery. Present annual catches of a few thousand tons are small by historical comparison, but the exploitation rate may now be relatively high given the low stock abundance. The decline in anchovy abundance coincides with recent die-offs and reproductive failures of anchovy-dependent predators in the ecosystem (e.g., sea lions and pelicans).},

The method is illustrated by application to$\backslash$nskipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the western Pacific Ocean.$\backslash$nSkipjack movement is shown to be highly variable at both seasonal$\backslash$nand interannual time scales. Comparison with the results of a spatially$\backslash$naggregated analysis of the same data reveals that the spatial model$\backslash$nprovides a much better fit to the data and, unlike the spatially$\backslash$naggregated model, enables estimation of the natural mortality rate$\backslash$nfree of the effects of movement within the model domain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nR�sum� : La mobilit� des populations de poisson est souvent ignor�e$\backslash$ndans les mod�les de dynamique des populations. Cependant, dans de$\backslash$nnombreux cas (celui des thons au premier chef), les d�placements$\backslash$net l'h�t�rog�n�it� spatiale peuvent �tre des caract�ristiques marquantes$\backslash$ndes populations de poisson et de leur exploitation. Nous d�crivons$\backslash$nun cadre quantitatif g�n�ral permettant d'estimer les d�placements$\backslash$net la mortalit� des populations de poisson � partir de donn�es de$\backslash$nmarquage. Les d�placements sont repr�sent�s par un processus d'advection$\backslash$net de diffusion, qui est, pour une population, l'�quivalent des d�placements$\backslash$nal�atoires biais�s d'un individu. Nous fournissons les approximations$\backslash$nen diff�rences finies n�cessaires pour r�soudre l'�quation diff�rentielle$\backslash$npartielle. Nous avons param�tr� le mod�le en supposant que les param�tres$\backslash$ndes d�placements sont homog�nes dans les r�gions et saisons sp�cifi�es,$\backslash$nque la mortalit� par p�che est proportionnelle � l'effort de p�che$\backslash$net que la mortalit� naturelle est constante dans l'espace et dans$\backslash$nle temps. Tous les param�tres du mod�le sont estim�s simultan�ment$\backslash$nselon le maximum de vraisemblance. Nous avons appliqu� notre m�thode$\backslash$n� la bonite � ventre ray� (Katsuwonus pelamis) de l'ouest du Pacifique.$\backslash$nNous avons montr� que les d�placements de ce poisson sont tr�s variables$\backslash$nd'une saison et d'une ann�e � l'autre. La comparaison avec les r�sultats$\backslash$nd'une analyse spatialement agr�g�e des m�mes donn�es montre que le$\backslash$nmod�le spatial donne un bien meilleur ajustement aux donn�es et,$\backslash$n� la diff�rence du mod�le spatialement agr�g�, permet d'estimer le$\backslash$ntaux de mortalit� naturelle sans qu'interviennent les effets des$\backslash$nd�placements dans le domaine du mod�le.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics and chaotic and complex systems constitute some of the most fascinating developments of late twentieth century mathematics and physics. The implications have changed our understanding of important phenomena in almost every field of science, including biology and ecology. This article investigates complexity and chaos in the spatiotemporal dynamics of aquatic ecosystems. The dynamics of these biological communities exhibit an interplay between processes acting on a scale from hundreds of meters to kilometers, controlled by biology, and processes acting on a scale from dozens to hundreds of kilometers, dominated by the heterogeneity of hydrophysical fields. We focus on how biological processes affect spatiotemporal pattern formation. Our results show that modeling by reaction-diffusion equations is an appropriate tool for investigating fundamental mechanisms of complex spatiotemporal plankton dynamics, fractal properties of planktivorous fish school movements, and their interrelationships.},

Solutions of the 2-dimensional advection-diffusion-mortality equation are presented which enable larval losses between release and recruitment sites to be quantified. The model assumes constant mean advection, eddy diffusivity and larval mortality. Solutions confirm that dspersal can make a significant contribution to pelagic losses and that survival is highly sensitive to the level of mean advection. The solutions have been used to examine the minimum fecundity required to overcome pelagic larval losses from a population.},

abstract = {Many biological populations breed seasonally and have nonoverlapping generations, so that their dynamics are described by first-order difference equations, Nt+1 = F (Nt). In many cases, F(N) as a function of N will have a hump. We show, very generally, that as such a hump steepens, the dynamics goes from a stable point, to a bifurcating hierarchy of stable cycles of period 2n, into a region of chaotic behavior where the population exhibits an apparently random sequence of "outbreaks" followed by "crashes." We give a detailed account of the underlying mathematics of this process and review other situations (in two- and higher dimensional systems, or in differential equation systems) where apparently random dynamics can arise from bifurcation processes. This complicated behavior, in simple deterministic models, can have disturbing implications for the analysis and interpretation of biological data.},

@article{Turing1952,
abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms controlling recruitment in fishes is a major problem in fisheries science. Although the literature on recruitment mechanisms is large and growing rapidly, it is primarily species specific. There is no conceptual framework to integrate the existing information on larval fish ecology and its relationship to survival and recruitment. In this paper, we propose an integrating framework based on body size. Although all larval fish are small relative to adult fish, total length at hatching differs among species by an order of magnitude. As many of the factors critical to larval survival and growth are size dependent, substantially different expectations arise about which mechanisms might be most important to recruitment success. We examined the evidence for the importance of size to feeding and starvation, to activity and searching ability, and to risk of predation. Regressions based on data from 72 species of marine and freshwater species suggest that body size is an important factor that unifies many of the published observations. A conceptual framework based on body size has the potential to provide a useful integration of the available data on larval growth and survival and a focus for future studies of recruitment dynamics.},

Somatic growth rates were strongly correlated with seawater temperature. Both otolith growth and RNAIDNA ratios were correlated with somatic growth. Age at metamorphosis declined with increasing temperature, but there was no relationshp between size at metamorphosis and temperature. Development seemed to be more related to temperature than to size. Large between-year differences were observed in the relationship between body size and otolith diameter. Otolith growth indces were used to compare back-calculated otolith growth between years or periods. In general growth was positively related to temperature, but early otolith growth was fastest at intermediate temperatures. It is proposed that the high temperature in 1989 had a negative effect on growth},

abstract = {In this study, clarification and consideration of the recruitment process in relation to the stock fluctuation of the Japanese sardine, which is one of the important pelagic fish in Japan was made. Recruitment mechanism for the sardine, namely the mechanism of the stock fluctuation has not been sufficiently explained, because there were few basic biological characteristics for many ecological results obtained up to present. More important thing in the sardine study at present is to estimate the past biological or ecological results again in order to find out new biological characteristics from them and to analyze the recruitment mechanism by a systematic integration of the basic characters. Some factors regarding the fluctuation in the recruitment process from the egg period to adding as a one-year-old fish from the viewpoints of the interrelations between physical and biological environment and the life history of the Japanese sardine were studied. Most of the data are from the spawning survey which have been carried out by the Marine Resources Division of the Tokai Regional Fisheries Laboratory and the ichthyoplankton survey within a 200 mile area from Japan under the guidance of the Fisheries Agency. Consideration was given to the recruitment mechanism related to the stock fluctuation on the basis of two important points, so as to clarify the status in taxonomy, morphology, early development, life cycle, developmental stages, migration, spawning characters, early mortality and the recruitment process of the Japanese sardine, and moreover, to analyze some environmental or ecological factors related to mortality during the recruitment process.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of strong meteorological perturbations in early spring on the success of mackerel (Scomber scombrus) recruitment in the N/NW Iberian area (southern Bay of Biscay) for the period 1999–2008. In 2000, the year of the most pronounced recruitment failure on record, two consecutive multidisciplinary surveys sampled hydrographic conditions and mackerel eggs, larvae and post-larvae over the main mackerel spawning grounds of the north and northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Analysis of egg and larval abundance and birthdates based on the otoliths of mackerel juveniles caught between July and October 2000 showed that there were no survivors from the early spring spawns, indicating a massive loss of early spawning effort. Moreover, the abundance of 1-year-old mackerel estimated from an acoustic survey carried out in 2001 was the lowest observed within the 1999–2008 time series. This low or null survival from the early spawns in 2000 could be due to the meteorological and oceanographic conditions of that spring, in particular two storm events in April after a relatively calm March. The first storm event from the north caused strong local wind in the southern Bay of Biscay but a weak oceanographic response. The second storm event from the southwest was mainly felt west of Galicia and caused a notable increase in shelf currents and a shift of the hydrographical structure along the shelf. Detailed analysis of strong wind pulses in early spring within the historical recruitment record suggests that strong local turbulence generated by high wind speeds and advection of larvae caused by the enhancement of shelf currents can contribute to reduced recruitment. Our observations indicate that, in 2000, both mechanisms were present.},

Early summer acoustic data of sardine juveniles were modelled using generalized additive models along with satellite environmental and bathymetry data. Selected models were used to construct maps that exhibit the probability of presence in the study areas, as well as throughout the entire Mediterranean basin, as a measure of habitat adequacy. Areas with high probability of supporting sardine juvenile presence persistently within the study period were identified throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, within the study period, a positive relationship was found between suitable habitat extent and the changes in abundance of sardine juveniles in each study area.},

At a regional (EEZ) scale, the study demonstrated that a large part of albacore CPUE variability can be explained by seasonal, interannual and spatial variation of the habitat. Results of the generalized linear models indicated that catch rates are higher than average in the northwestern part of the EEZ at the beginning of the year (January) and during the second half of the year (July–December). In the northwestern region of the EEZ, high CPUEs are associated with waters {\textless}20.5° in the intermediate layer and with moderate values of primary production. Longline CPUE also appeared to be dependent on prey densities, as predicted from a micronekton model. Albacore CPUE was highest at moderate densities of prey in the epipelagic layer during the night and for relatively low prey densities in the mesopelagic layer during the day. We also demonstrated that the highest CPUEs were recorded from 1986 to 1998, which corresponds to a period with frequent El Ni{\~{n}}o events.},

abstract = {In order to compensate for the resource demands of reproduction, organisms usually increase the amount of total food resources available. This may be achieved by different tactics of resource use that also include foraging decisions. Two such general tactics are discussed in this paper under the concepts of capital and income breeding. These are defined mainly from the temporal distribution of resource acquisition relative to resource use. A capital breeder acquires its resources in advance and store them endogenously or exogenously until they are needed to supply aspects of offspring production. An income breeder, on the other hand, adjusts its food intake concurrently with breeding, without reliance on stores. In a perfectly predictable environment without limited resources, income breeding is the best option since capital breeders may have to pay a number of energetic and demographic costs for their stored resources. However, under unpredictable food conditions, food/time limitations, and risky foraging conditions, capital breeding offers many benefits. The costing systems (pre- or postbreeding costs) induced by capital and income breeding will largely influence the opportunity for these energetic tactics to evolve. While capital and income breeders may potentially experience both pre- and postbreeding costs, capital breeders may be more exposed to prebreeding costs due to predation in connection with acquisition and carriage of stores.},

abstract = {Energy storage is an important component of life-history variation. Some organisms ("income breeders") fuel reproductive expenditure by simultaneous feeding, whereas others ("capital breeders") fuel reproduction from energy gained earlier, and stored prior to use. Most published discussions of this topic have focused primarily on endothermic animals (birds and mammals), and have interpreted the costs and benefits of these alternative breeding tactics in the context of endothermy. The far more diverse array of ectothermic animals has received less attention in this respect. Many features associated with ectothermy preadapt organisms to store energy for long periods prior to use (i.e. to rely on "capital" rather than "income"). For example, birds and mammals experience high costs (in terms of mobility and thermoregulatory efficiency) if they store large body reserves. By contrast, the energetic and demographic costs associated with storage, maintenance, and utilisation of body reserves are low in many ectotherms. Thus, capital breeding (which may also be more efficient energetically in many situations) is extremely common in these low energy systems. Ectotherms comprise the most extreme examples of capital breeders, with a strong tendency towards semelparity where the capital of reserves is massively invested into a single reproductive event. Overall, theoretical and empirical studies of the evolution of capital versus income breeding as alternative strategies of resource use should take account of the important role played by alternative thermoregulatory and metabolic systems. The acquisition of endothermy in avian and mammalian lineages has involved a massive shift towards reliance on "income breeding", and the full spectrum of life-history variation in this respect cannot be appreciated without detailed examination of ectothermic organisms.},

abstract = {Energy storage is an important component of life-history variation. A distinction is recognized between species that provision offspring using energy gained concurrently (income breeders) and those that provision offspring using energy stores accumulated at an earlier time (capital breeders). Although this distinction has been recognized for some time, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the general adaptive value of the 2 strategies. Here, we present a simple, general framework for modeling female reproductive strategies. We show that our framework can be applicable either to annual breeders that aim to maximize the energy delivered to their offspring before independence, or to species with shorter reproductive cycles that aim to maximize reproductive rate, given that their offspring must build up a given level of reserves before independence. For both scenarios, we show that the costs of accumulating capital can lead to pure income breeding, pure capital breeding, or a mixture of the 2 strategies. Our model allows the effects of a variety of parameters to be assessed. Length of gestation, offspring metabolism, efficiency of energy transfer from mother to offspring, and the relative rates of energy gain by females with and without offspring are all important factors. The cost associated with accumulated capital is a particularly critical determinant of the strategy adopted. More detailed approaches to specific systems may provide a greater understanding of the factors promoting different maternal strategies for offspring provisioning.},

abstract = {We compared a wide range of environmental data with measures of recruitment and stock production for Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus to examine factors potentially responsible for fishery regimes (periods of high or low recruitment and productivity). Environmental factors fall into two groups based on principal component analyses. The first principal component group was determined by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index and was dominated by variables associated with the Southern Oscillation Index and Kuroshio Sverdrup transport. The second was led by the Arctic Oscillation and dominated by variables associated with Kuroshio geostrophic transport. Instantaneous surplus production rates (ISPR) and log recruitment residuals (LNRR) changed within several years of environmental regime shifts and then stabilized due, we hypothesize, to rapid changes in carrying capacity and relaxation of density dependent effects. Like ISPR, LNRR appears more useful than fluctuation in commercial catch data for identifying the onset of fishery regime shifts. The extended Ricker models indicate spawning stock biomass and sea surface temperatures (SST) affect recruitment of sardine while spawning stock biomass, SST and sardine biomass affect recruitment of chub mackerel. Environmental conditions were favorable for sardine during 1969–87 and unfavorable during 1951–67 and after 1988. There were apparent shifts from favorable to unfavorable conditions for chub mackerel during 1976–77 and 1985–88, and from unfavorable to favorable during 1969–70 and 1988–92. Environmental effects on recruitment and surplus production are important but fishing effects are also influential. For example, chub mackerel may have shifted into a new favorable fishery regime in 1992 if fishing mortality had been lower. We suggest that managers consider to shift fishing effort in response to the changing stock productivity, and protect strong year classes by which we may detect new favorable regimes.},

abstract = {We analyzed sea surface temperature, salinity, and depth in the spawning grounds of three small pelagic fishes, Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus), Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), and Pacific round herring (Etrumeus teres), to compare species-specific characteristics of spawning based on a long-term dataset of egg surveys off Japan from 1978 to 2004. A total of 133,294 samples were obtained by vertical tows of plankton nets. Temperature-salinity-depth plots of the spawning grounds of the three species indicated broad temperature and salinity ranges for anchovy, reflecting a wide distribution from coastal to offshore waters, compared to sardine. Spawning activities of round herring were observed in similar temperature but narrower salinity ranges compared to anchovy. These species-specific temperature/ salinity characteristics reflect differences in the location and bottom depth distribution of their spawning grounds. Differential spawning strategies are also reflected in the species-specific relationships between spawning area and egg abundances.},

abstract = {We estimated the stock size of Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) in the Sea of Japan and East China Sea since 1953 using cohort analysis based on the changes of growth patterns. Growth of Japanese sardine, estimated by using annual rings on archived scales since 1961, showed that body lengths were extremely stunted in the 1980-1987 year-classes. The body length at age 3 from February to April in the 1980-1987 year-classes, a period when the stock size exceeded 4 million tons, was 180.0 +/- 2.6 mm (mean +/- SD), and in the other year-classes was 195.1 +/- 7.6 mm. The body length at age 3 and wet weight of zooplankton in August in the offshore area of the Sea of Japan had a significantly positive correlation. We assumed three scenarios for maturation ratios, and estimated Ricker's spawner-recruitment relationships. We analyzed the correlations between logarithmic recruitment residuals (LNRR) and environmental factors in winter, represented by the North Pacific index (NPI), Aleutian low pressure index (ALPI), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), monsoon index (MOI), Arctic oscillation (AO) and Southern oscillation index (SOI). Significant correlations were observed between MOI and LNRR and between AO and LNRR. A combination of strong MOI and weak AO would increase the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton and subsequently increase the recruitment of Japanese sardine.},

abstract = {Engraulis capensis (Gilchrist) is capable of both filter and particulate feeding, the latter being the dominant mode. Food concentrations required to initiate filter feeding were inversely related to particle size. Turning rate, swimming speed and feeding mode also depended on prey size. The anchovy switched from filtering to biting at a threshold prey size of 0.710 to 0.720 mm; the feeding mode employed by the fish on prey approximating this size depended upon prey concentration. Biting clearance rates were greater than those for filtering, and the fish fed at maximum rate over most of their prey size spectrum. These results indicate that E. capensis had adapted its feeding behaviour to maximise food intake and to minimise energy expenditure. The selective grazing of E. capensis may have a significant effect on the structure of its prey communities.},

abstract = {Seasonal variability in the growth of larval Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus was examined through otolith microstructure analysis based on the samples collected from the northern side (inner area, IA) and the southern side (outer area, OA) of the Kii Channel from April 2006 to March 2007. Growth trajectories (otolith backcalculated mean standard length of 5 day intervals from 5 days after hatch to 24 days) as well as the most recent 5 day mean growth rate of larvae before capture (G(5)) differed among months. Growth trajectories showed the same pattern as G(5). In IA, mean +/-s.d.G(5) ranged from 0.31 +/- 0.04 mm day(-1) (January) to 0.73 +/- 0.06 mm day(-1) (October). In OA, mean +/-s.d.G(5) ranged from 0.36 +/- 0.05 mm day(-1) (January) to 0.79 +/- 0.11 mm day(-1) (August). G(5) values declined from November to January and then started to increase. In general, the seasonal patterns of growth were similar between IA and OA, and a clear seasonal pattern in growth was identified. When the relationships among larval growth rate, sea temperature, zooplankton density and larval density were examined, growth rate was positively related with sea temperature in both areas and not related with the other factors. The similar pattern in growth observed between IA and OA was probably due to the low spatial variability in sea temperature compared to its seasonal variability.},

abstract = {Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are famous for their homing migrations from oceanic feeding grounds to their natal river to spawn. During these migrations, salmon travel through diverse habitats (e.g. oceans, lakes, rivers), each offering distinct orientation clues and, perhaps, requiring distinct sensory capabilities for navigation. Despite these challenges, homing is generally precise and this philopatry has resulted in reproductively isolated spawning populations with specialized adaptations for their natal habitat. This paper reviews the mechanisms underlying all aspects of salmon homing but emphasizes the final, freshwater phase governed by olfactory recognition of homestream water. Prior to their seaward migration, juvenile salmon learn (imprint on) odors associated with their natal site and later, as adults, use these odor memories for homing. Our understanding of this imprinting process is derived primarily from studies using artificial odorants and hatchery-reared salmon. Recent findings suggest, however, that such studies may underestimate the complexity of the imprinting process in nature.},

abstract = {Hake recruitment has been examined in relation to environmental variables in two of the main reproductive areas of the central Mediterranean, the northern and central Tyrrhenian Sea. Seventeen years time series data from trawl surveys revealed high fluctuations in recruit abundance that could not be just explained by spawning biomass estimations. Generalized additive models were developed to investigate hake recruitment dynamics in the Tyrrhenian Sea in relation to spawner abundance and selected key oceanographic variables. Environmental data were explored in attempt to explain survival processes that could affect early life history stages of hake and that accounted for high fluctuations in its recruitment. Thermal anomalies in summer, characterised by high peaks in water temperature, revealed a negative effect on the abundance of recruits in autumn, probably due to a reduction in hake egg and larval survival rates. In the northern Tyrrhenian, recruitment was reduced when elevated sea-surface temperatures were coupled with lower levels of water circulation. Enhanced spring primary production, related to late winter low temperatures could affect water mass productivity in the following months, thus influencing spring recruitment. In the central Tyrrhenian a dome-shaped relationship between wind mixing in early spring and recruitment could be interpreted as an "optimal environmental window" in which intermediate water mixing level played a positive role in phytoplankton displacement, larval feeding rate and appropriate larval drift. Results are discussed in relation to the decline in hake stock biomass and within the present climate change and global warming context. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The recruitment rate of Peruvian anchoveta, Engraulis ringens, was studied to test the hypothesis that long-term environmental variation (regime shifts) had a significant impact on density-dependent processes governing the anchovy recruitment during the period 1963-2004. On the basis of previous defined regimes and turning points for the Humboldt Current System, we identified two groups of years for increased recruitment of anchoveta (1963-1971 and 1986-2004), and one unfavorable period (1972-1985). A common intercept and significantly different slopes were found when the recruitment rate was plotted as a function of the spawning stock biomass during those groups of years, suggesting that density-dependent effects on recruitment were affected during different climate regimes. The favorable (unfavorable) regime was characterized by higher (lower) zooplankton volumes, and with a higher frequency of colder (warmer) waters. Dome-shaped relationships between recruitment rate, spawning stock biomass and SST, were detected with a Generalized Additive Model for the favorable regime. Thus, recruitment could be explained by non-linear effects of environmental variables. Ultimately, climatic regimes are affecting the density-dependent effects on recruitment of anchoveta and the mechanisms involved may be associated with changes in the carrying capacity of the spawning habitat of anchoveta off Peru, which in turn are related with the effects of cold and warm regimes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus, L.) is one the most important commercial species of the Adriatic Sea. With a surface area of 138,000 km2, about one twentieth of the Mediterranean Sea, the Adriatic Sea produced about 13,000 tonnes of anchovy in 1991, equal to 19{\%} of the Mediterranean anchovy catches. The value of Adriatic anchovy catches has been$\backslash$nestimated at about 15.6 MECU in 1991. Adriatic anchovy catches were very high in the late seventies (53,000 tonnes, average 1978-1980), then they decreased in the following years, until they collapsed in 1987. During this year, with a fishing effort similar to previous years, catches were only 3,700 tonnes. In successive years, stock recovered partially and anchovy$\backslash$ncatches increased to 10,000-15,000 tonnes. Anchovy is caught by Italian fishermen using two kind of fishing gears: midwater pair trawls (Italian name is volante) and purse seines (Italian name is lampara). The same fishing gears also catch sardines (Sardina pilchardus, Walb.). The volante is mainly used in the northern and central Adriatic. At present about 70 couples of fishing vessels use this gear, their average engine power is 400 HP, average size of the vessels is 50 GRT. The lampara vessels operating in the Adriatic Sea number about 40 and they are concentrated, mainly, in the southern part of the Adriatic Sea. The lampara vessels, generally, have a bigger size than volante vessels (average of GRT is 85), but they have lower engine power (average of HP is 300). Since 1975, IRPEM has carried out a research programme on stock assessment of Engraulis encrasicolus (L.) and Sardina pilchardus (Walb.) in the Adriatic Sea, using population dynamic models. IRPEM collects catches by species (anchovy and sardine), effort data, fishing fleet characteristics and length frequency data. Stock assessments and biomass estimations of anchovy have been carried out in the last twenty years using direct methods as echosurveys and ichthyoplankton surveys as well as indirect (catch and effort and VPA) methods. Anchovies biomass is estimated around 50,000 tonnes in the years 1990-1992. In recent years anchovy catches are about the 30{\%} of estimated biomass. The exploitable stock size each year seems determined in the main by the size of the recruitment in the two immediately$\backslash$npreceding years rather than by the prevailing levels of fishing effort. },

Recently, the government has decided to implement RBM in the pelagic fisheries in the form of a system that allocates individual quotas for vessels licensed to harvest Peruvian anchoveta. The aim of this paper is to analyse the introduced individual vessel quota (IVQ) system and to identify factors that may have the potential to either aid or undermine the achievement of the objective of reducing the race for fish. The non-transferability characteristic of the vessel quota may aid protecting the social fabric from concentration of rights. A substantial fleet reduction, however, may not be achieved. Measures to permanently eliminate redundant capacity and thus the threat of the race for fish may be required. Such measures should comprise either decommissioning schemes or instruments to regulate transferability. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Birds made 14.5 dive bouts per day of on average 15.4 min duration, which consisted of on average 16.2 dives of 12.1 m depth and 42.7 s duration. Birds made 13.87.3 flight bouts per day, which lasted on average 11.54.5 min. Daily total flight duration was 2.71.7 h (range 54 s–5.1 h) and the mean potential foraging range was estimated to be 87 km (maximum 164 km). Most birds stayed at the colony or rested on the water surface during the night. Rhinoceros auklets dived more actively in early morning and in late afternoon than during mid-day. Compared to results from studies of time allocation in other alcids species, rhinoceros auklets spent longer time flying (3.3 hd−1) and resting on water (13.1 hd−1), and less time diving (3.1 hd−1) and staying at the colony (4.4 hd−1). These foraging patterns are probably related to the nest attendance pattern of rhinoceros auklets, i.e. leaving the colony early in the morning, staying at sea all the day and returning to the colony in the evening to provision their chicks.},

Chick diet showed decadal changes in coastal pelagic fish, with a switch from sardine Sardinops melanostictus to anchovy Engraulis japonicus in the late 1980s corresponding to intensification of the TC. There were no long-term trends in the timing of breeding or breeding success of rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata and Japanese cormorant Phalacrocorax filamentosus, but these variables were affected by interannual variation in spring air and sea temperatures, as well as the timing of TC warm water intrusions within the foraging range ({\~{}}60 km from the colony) of the birds. Effects include: (1) freezing of the breeding grounds by winter winds limiting access to nesting grounds and (2) availability of anchovy and sandlance Ammodytes personatus affecting chick diet, growth, and breeding success. We did not detect relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and the availability of prey species. The timing and success of black-tailed gulls Larus crassirostris, which fed mainly on sandlance, however, could not be explained by these factors. Our study indicates potential links between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index and the flow rate of the TC, and between the Arctic Oscillation index and local wind stress, and suggests that broad-scale atmospheric pressure fields influence local weather, oceanography, and seabirds indirectly through changes in prey availability.},

abstract = {The influence of temperature-induced changes in water viscosity on the swimming performance and kinematics of larval Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) was examined using high-speed video recording. The physical effects of viscosity were measured separately from the physiological (Q10) effects of temperature by increasing the viscosity using methyl cellulose. Voluntary swimming speeds of large larvae (18.2 mm total length) were characterized by Reynolds numbers based on length (ReL) between 100 and 500 and varied with temperature and viscosity. Speeds of small larvae (9.6 mm) at ReL between 25 and 125 were strongly affected by viscosity, but virtually unaffected by temperature at equal viscosities. Speeds of large larvae were modulated by transverse tail speed. Small (viscosity-dominated) larvae altered both transverse tail speed and tail amplitude to vary their swimming speed. Stride lengths for both sizes of larvae followed predictions for viscous-regime swimming until ReL{\textgreater}450. The combined data suggest that the viscous hydrodynamic regime for larval herring extends to at least ReL=300 and that viscosity could be important up to ReL of approximately 450. Because the physical effects of viscosity supplement the physiological effects of temperature on locomotor performance (when ReL is below approximately 300), indices such as Q10 can greatly overestimate the dependence of physiological processes on temperature, as demonstrated by an example.},

abstract = {We present a summary of variability in age and length at metamorphosis for marine fishes. Data from the literature were partitioned into taxonomic, population, and individual levels of resolution to examine the factors affecting the timing of metamorphosis. Temperature appears to be a dominant influence on timing, likely due to its effect on growth rate. Interspecifically, length at metamorphosis correlated poorly with that at hatching but was significantly related to temperature. This pattern was inconsistent for population-level comparisons. Metamorphic age decreased exponentially with increasing temperature in interspecific and population-level comparisons but did not covary with length for either level of resolution. This suggests that age at metamorphosis largely reflects the time required to grow to a given metamorphic length. Within populations, the correlation between metamorphic age and length increases with growth rate, a reflection of variance in age and length. A strong exponential relationship between mean metamorphic age and length and their associated variability (SD) exists, with a slope greater than unity in both cases (i.e., variability increases relative to the mean). With these relationships, we can infer the manner in which individual variability in metamorphic traits is generated throughout ontogeny. These results are considered in light of recruitment variability in marine fishes.},

Rearing containers ranging in capacity from 4.5 to 510 l were tested; the smaller ones were found to be most useful for laboratory experimentation. Irreversible starvation occurred when E. mordax were denied food for more than 1.5 days after yolk absorption. Growth rates of larval anchovies fed different diets were compared. Larvae fed G. splendens grew for 1 week at the same rate as animals fed wild plankton, but did not maintain this rate. Laboratory survival of E. mordax larvae on a diet of G. splendens alone, did not differ significantly when veligers supplemented the diet. However, when G. splendens and veligers were fed simultaneously to E. mordax larvae, growth rate was greatly improved, although still not matching the growth attained on a diet of wild plankton. Length (L) versus weight (W) analyses were made for all larvae at all diets. The results showed that weight could be calculated most accurately from length by the relationship log W=3.3237 log L-3.8205, regardless of diet.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the link between swimming endurance and condition of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua that had been fed or starved during the 16 weeks preceding the tests, and assessed whether muscle metabolic capacities explain such links. The condition factor [(somatic mass x fork length(-3))x100] of starved cod was 0.54+/-0.1 whereas that of fed cod was 0.81+/-0.1. In white and red muscle, we measured four glycolytic enzymes: phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), two mitochondrial enzymes: cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and citrate synthase (CS), a biosynthetic enzyme, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), glycogen and protein levels and water content. Muscle samples were taken at three positions along the length of the fish; starvation affected the metabolic capacities of white muscle more than those of red muscle. The levels of glycolytic enzymes and glycogen changed more in white than red muscle during starvation. Both in fed and starved cod, muscle metabolic capacities varied with position along the fish; starvation reduced this longitudinal variation more in white than red muscle. In white muscle of fed cod, the glycolytic enzyme levels increased from head to tail, while in starved cod this longitudinal variation disappeared. In red muscle mitochondrial enzyme levels were highest in the caudal sample, but fewer differences were found for glycolytic enzymes. Swimming endurance was markedly affected by fish condition, with starved fish swimming only 30{\%} of the time (and distance) of fed fish. This endurance was closely linked with the number of burst-coast movements during the test and the activity of CCO and LDH in white muscle. The number of burst-coast movements was significantly linked with condition factor and PFK activity in caudal red muscle and gill arch mass. Our data indicated that cod use both glycolytic and oxidative capacities to support endurance swimming. Furthermore, swimming endurance is linked with the metabolic capacities of red and white muscle.},

abstract = {In the field, Atlantic cod face seasonal changes in food availability that in turn lead to changes in condition. To examine the physiological consequences of these changes in condition, we measured routine metabolic rate (RMR) to estimate standard metabolic rate (SMR), active metabolic rate (AMR), aerobic scope, critical swimming speed (Ucrit), cost of transport, sprint performance, time to exhaustion, and postexhaustion metabolic rate (EMR) for 24 Atlantic cod from the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Cod were measured at their initial condition (condition factor of 0.676+/-0.076) and after 9 wk of feeding (condition factor of 0.923+/-0.096). These levels of condition are representative of wild cod in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the spring and during the fall-early winter, respectively. The improved condition did not change mass-specific SMR. However, mass-specific AMR, aerobic scope, and EMR decreased with the improvement in condition. The various measures of swimming performance were affected differently. Ucrit increased and cost of transport at 1.3 and 1.5 body lengths s(-1) decreased with improved condition, but the cost of transport at 0.3, 0.9, 1.1, 1.7, and 1.9 body lengths s(-1), sprint performance, and time to exhaustion did not change. Hierarchies for the speed at first burst-coast, the proportion of Ucrit supported by burst-coasts, and time to exhaustion were maintained with the improvement in condition. The relationships between metabolic rates and swimming performance differed with condition level, with stronger correlations apparent in the cod at their initial condition. Given the low condition of wild cod stocks, these responses indicate that reduced performance, due to both maintenance of metabolic expenditures and modified swimming capacities, may impair survival under conditions of reduced food availability.},

abstract = {We observed substantial variation in seasonal growth rates, autumn body size, and growing-season mortality among eight experimental cohorts of age-0 rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Wet mass, water, lipids (storage), and lipid-free dry mass (structure) had biphasic allometries with inflexions at ?10 cm in length. Dry:wet mass and storage:structure ratios were positively related to fish length, indicating that the relative quantities of these constituents change with body size. Lipid concentration varied according to a sigmoid relationship with wet mass which also had a growth-rate dependence. Inde- pendent assessments of the allometry of growing-season survival and winter metabolism facilitated assessment of the costs and benefits of two alternate energy allocation strategies of young fish. For cohorts with low growth rates and small autumn body size, a somatic growth rate maximization strategy is optimum, producing a 5{\%} net survival advantage over an energy storage maximization strategy. For cohorts with intermediate growth rates and autumn mass, somatic growth and energy storage strategies lead to similar first-year sur- vival. The fastest growing cohorts are estimated to have a net survival advantage of 7{\%}, by adopting an energy storage maximization strategy over a growth rate maximization strategy.},

abstract = {How large size affects overwinter growth and survival of age-0 fish may vary as a function of food, predation, and energetic condition. During two winters in Ohio, we assessed how these factors affected growth and survival of varying sizes of age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) by combining a field survey (N = 2 reservoirs) with multiscale experiments (reservoirs, ponds, outdoor pools). In our survey, more small ({\textless}100 mm total length) individuals died by spring in one reservoir than in the other. Similarly, when we stocked two reservoirs with marked age-0 largemouth bass in fall, mortality of small individuals was higher in one system overwinter, potentially due to differences in predation intensity. In ponds during two winters, size-selective mortality of small largemouth bass occurred in only two of eight ponds, potentially as a function of cannibalism. Varying ration in pools (starved, 0.5× maintenance, or 1.5× maintenance) did not affect survival, even though starved individuals lost substantial wet weight and energy content. Only when predators were present did small individuals die at high rates, although energy depletion may have contributed to predatory mortality. To increase the probability of overwinter survival, managers should seek to improve first-summer growth, reduce winter predation, and increase winter forage.},

abstract = {Understanding the evolution of growth rate re- quires knowledge of the physiology of growth. This study explored the physiological basis of countergradient variation (CnGV) in somatic growth across latitudinal populations of the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia. Energetics of northern (Nova Scotia, Canada) and south- ern (South Carolina, USA) genotypes were compared across resource levels, temperatures, and fish sizes to identify trade-offs to rapid growth. Offered unlimited re- sources, genotypes differed in both energy acquisition and allocation. Food consumption, growth, and efficien- cy of northern genotypes were consistently higher than in southern genotypes, across temperatures and body siz- es. Feeding metabolism (specific dynamic action; SDA) was proportional to meal size, differing between geno- types to the extent that food consumption differed. Given limited resources, northern and southern genotypes dis- played similar growth, efficiency, routine activity, and SDA across temperatures and fish sizes. Routine metab- olism was equal at 17°C and 22°C, yet was significantly higher in northern fish at 28°C. Growth rates in M. meni- dia do not appear to trade off across environments or body sizes, i.e., at no temperature, ration, or size do southern fish outgrow northern conspecifics. Nor does submaximal growth result from increased costs of main- tenance, tissue synthesis, or routine activity. Based on our findings, we propose that CnGV consumption and growth in M. menidia likely result from trade-offs with J.M.

abstract = {Multivariate analysis identified a two-dimensional continuum of life-history variation among 301 fish species from Europe, North America, South America and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America. The first axis was associated with larger body size, higher fecundity, delayed maturation, fewer reproductive events, and shorter breeding season on one end and small size, low fecundity, early maturity, multiple reproductive events per year, and prolonged breeding season on the other. The second axis contrasted fishes having larger eggs and more parental care against fishes with the opposite suite of traits. Phylogenetic affiliations of specieswere apparent in the general patterns of ordination of species within orders, indicating evolutionary divergences in life-history patterns. In fact, partitioning the variance of life-history traits showed that taxonomic order and latitude conditions and recruitment when early life stages encounter suitable environmental conditions. Similarly, latit- udinal affiliations were also observed: opportunistic strategists more common in tropical latitudes and periodic strategists more common in temperate and Arctic latitudes. were the most important factors and geographic region and habitat the least. Despite phylogenetic constraints, basic life-history patterns showed consistency between distantly geographical regions, latitudinal ranges and basic adult habitats, indicating convergences in life-history patterns.Although the basic life-history patterns seemed repeatable among distantly related taxa, geographical and latitudinal affiliations were apparent. Species from South America are skewed toward the opportunistic endpoint, whereas North American marine species are skewed toward the periodic endpoint of the trilateral continuum model. Most of the fish species from South American data set came from fluctuating environments, so an opportunistic strategy of early maturation and continuous spawning permits efficient recolonization of habitats over small spatial scales. In contrast, most species in the North American and European data sets came from seasonal habitats that are nonethelessmore hydrological stable, so a periodic strategy of delaying maturation to attain large clutches enhances adult survivorship during suboptimal environmental},

abstract = {For fish at high latitudes, short growing seasons should constrain size-at-age, although the converse often occurs. We used a dynamic state variable model to find energy allocation strategies to length, fat, and ovaries that maximize expected egg production of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). We determined how latitudes and rations affect optimal allocation and then simulated growth using optimal strategies. A theoretical reciprocal transplant explored how latitude-specific optimal strategies affected growth at other latitudes. At low ration, allocation and growth were similar among latitudes, with length selected in small individuals and reproductive tissue and fat in large counterparts. At high rations, low-latitude fish invested most energy to length and reproduction; high-latitude fish allocated to length during summer and fat during fall and developed ovaries earlier in the year. Transplants revealed that smaller size-at-age occurs in the north than in the south, consistent with field patterns for largemouth bass. Although northern strategies allowed fish to be successful in the south, southern strategies were unsuccessful in the north. Latitude-specific energetic adaptations may compromise success of fish transplanted beyond their native distribution.},

Prior to this study, our understanding of Dover sole reproductive biology was limited to the stock off the US west coast. This study was initiated to determine the length and age at maturity for Dover sole in the GOA. We also compared the length at maturity and growth rate across latitudes to test the hypothesis that individuals near the northern extent of their range (GOA stock) mature at a larger size than individuals in the southern stock off California and Oregon. Female Dover sole (n = 273) ranging in length from 198-663 mm were collected opportunistically around Kodiak Island, Alaska, (55-59??N) from February 2000 to October 2001, with sampling concentrated in the months February-April, June-July, and October-November. All ovaries were examined to determine the maturity stage using standard histological criteria. The spawning season of Dover sole in the GOA spanned at least 4 months, from February to May. Dover sole in the GOA matured at a larger size than those off California and Oregon, with an estimated length at 50{\%} maturity (ML 50) of 439 mm. At the same fish length that nearly 100{\%} of Dover sole from California and Oregon waters are mature, Dover sole in the GOA are just beginning to mature. The estimated age at 50{\%} maturity (MA50) for female Dover sole in the GOA was 6.7 years and was similar to the MA 50 for cohorts at more southern latitudes. We attribute the latitudinal variation in ML50, combined with the similar MA 50 across latitudes, to spatial differences in growth rates.},

Although fish also exhibit robust seasonal responses, they do not possess an anatomically distinct pars tuberalis. Here we report that the saccus vasculosus of fish is a seasonal sensor. We observe expression of key genes regulating seasonal reproduction and rhodopsin family genes in the saccus vasculosus of masu salmon. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that all of these genes are expressed in the coronet cells of the saccus vasculosus, suggesting the existence of a photoperiodic signalling pathway from light input to neuroendocrine output. In addition, isolated saccus vasculosus has the capacity to respond to photoperiodic signals, and its removal abolishes photoperiodic response of the gonad. Although the physiological role of the saccus vasculosus has been a mystery for several centuries, our findings indicate that the saccus vasculosus acts as a sensor of seasonal changes in day length in fish.},

Thereafter, since many fishes live in detrimental environments, mainly induced by the continuous input of xenobiotic substances into waterways, the authors found it highly pertinent to include this topic.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This review summarizes the knowledge of environmental regulation of annual reproductive cycles in teleosts displaying various spawning periods. Warm temperature is the important factor which causes initiation of the spawning period in both of spring spawning and "spring-to-summer" spawning teleosts, and high temperature during sum- mer is the predominant factor that causes termination of the spawning period in the spring spawning species. In the spring-to-summer spawning species, short daylength in autumn is the predominant factor that causes the termination of the spawning period. In autumn spawning teleosts, short daylength is the predominant factor that causes initia- tion of the spawning period, and low temperature during winter is the predominant fac- tor that causes the termination. In summer spawning, spring and autumn spawning, and "winter-to-spring" spawning species, changes in water temperature seem to be the impor- tant factors for both initiation of and termination of the spawning period, although daylength might also be concerned in some cases. In several cases regardless of the types of the spawning period, internal factor such as circa-annual rhythm might be concerned with the environmental regulation, through changes in photoperiodism appearance and/ or existence of a refractory period.},

abstract = {This paper describes a reanalysis of the variability of water mass properties and currents in the western North Pacific using an ocean forecast system, Japan Coastal Ocean Predictability Experiment 2 (JCOPE2), to provide the basic description and information about the quality for data users. We have created the reanalysis data with high horizontal resolution of 1/12 degrees to describe the oceanic variability associated with the Kuroshio-Kuroshio Extension, the Ovashio, and the mesoscale eddies from 1993 to 2007. The products made by an eddy-resolving ocean model combined with the three-dimensional variational data assimilation well reproduced the mean water mass property in the western North Pacific and the interannual variations of the Kuroshio-Kuroshio Extension and the Oyashio coastal branch. From the reanalysis data, we found that both the mean kinetic energy of the Kuroshio Extension axis at the first meandering crest and southward intrusion of the Ovashio coastal branch were closely related with the horizontal distribution of both the Oyashio Water and North Pacific Intermediate Water within the appropriate interannual time scale. The reanalysis data also indicated that the north-south migration of the Kuroshio Extension associated with its regime transitions affected the decadal modulation of the Subtropical Mode Water formation in the recirculation gyre of the Kuroshio Extension.},

abstract = {Early life history traits of Japanese anchovy in the northeastern waters of Taiwan, with reference to larvae transport. Zoological Studies 42(2): 248-257. There is controversy concerning the location of spawning sites and recruiting routes of Japanese anchovy in the northeastern Taiwan. Early in the larval fish fishery season, we conducted a survey along a presumptive coastal current to Ilan Bay with the aim of obtaining anchovy larvae for demographic analysis. The obtained samples of the Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus, were analyzed to elucidate the species, directional tendency, which was from offshore to inshore, and which reached coastal Ilan Bay along the western boundary of the Kuroshio Current during late April. Demographic analysis indicated that offshore anchovy larvae had the smallest body size, and that the size increased from offshore toward the coastal. Based on the sagittal microstructural analy- sis, detailed early life history traits, such as increment size, standard length and body weight at daily ages were back-calculated, then various relationships were estimated, and significant differences were shown to have an offshore-coastal tendency. Estimated developmental stability exhibited highest variation in transitional inshore area and lowest variation in coastal area. The mean daily growth rate in standard length was 0.28 mm d-1 for larvae in the offshore area and 0.54 mm d-1 for those in the coastal area. However, the inshore larval popula- tion exhibited a non-steady growth pattern, which was 0.27 mm d-1 corresponding to an offshore environment during a period of 7-24 April, but had a subsequent higher growth rate of 0.59 mm d-1, whose value was similar to that of the coastal population. These findings combined with local flow pattern and sea surface temperature images support the hypothesis that anchovy larvae are transported from offshore at Pangaiyu to the coastal area of the Ilan Bay, along with a previously identified coastal current in northeastern Taiwan waters. Coastal area of Ilan Bay serves as an important nursery ground for late anchovy larvae. http://www.sinica.edu.tw/zool/zoolstud/42.2/248.pdf},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that strong recruitment in Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus occurs only in years when larval growth is fast and predation pressure-as measured by selection for fast growth-is weak. Four annual cohorts of larvae (1997, 1998, 1999 {\&} 2000) were sampled on the Magdalen Shallows, southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, and 1 yr old mackerel juveniles were sampled the year after in the mackerel fishery of the southern Gulf. The early larval growth trajectories of both larvae and juveniles were back-calculated from the analysis of the sagittal otolith. Interannual differences in growth measured in the larvae persisted in the juveniles. The growth of larvae was significantly higher in 1999, an exceptional year class, than in the 3 other weak year classes. Surviving juveniles of the strong 1999 and the weak 1997 year classes grew equally fast during the first 40 d of larval life, but selection for fast growth was mild in 1999 and severe in 1997. We conclude that fast early growth measured in 1 yr old juveniles reflected fast growth of the entire larval population in 1999, and strong selective mortality against slow-growing larvae in 1997. Early growth was slow in larvae and juveniles of the weak 1998 (mild selection) and 2000 (no selection) year classes. Consistent with the hypothesis, the combination of fast growth and weak selection for fast growth unique to the 1999 cohort resulted in exceptional recruitment.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments investigated the effect of food particle size and concentration on the feeding behaviour of adult pilchard Sardinops sagax. This species employs 2 methods of feeding: filter-feeding and particulate-feeding. Particles of less than 1230 mu m total length elicit a filtering response while larger particles elicit particulate-feeding at low concentrations and filter-feeding at high concentrations. Clearance rate during filtering is independent of particle size and concentration over the size range 393 to 1227 mu m, with a mean value of 11.78 plus or minus 4.91 l/fish/min. This value is 93{\%}, of the calculated maximum clearance rate for filtering fish, implying that pilchard are highly efficient at feeding over this size range. Particles of less than 206 mu m are cleared at reduced rates, with retention efficiency inversely proportional to particle size. Clearance rates during particulate-feeding are greater than those for filtering, and increase with increasing particle size to a predicted saturation value of 46.53 l/fish/min. Pilchard display size-selectivity during particulate-feeding, preferentially removing larger prey items. Results indicate that pilchard is primarily a filter-feeder, obtaining the majority of its food from the smaller end of the size spectrum of available prey. Microzooplankton, and to a lesser extent phytoplankton, are major dietary components. This is in contrast to Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis, which is primarily a particulate-feeder and derives most of its food from the larger end of the size spectrum of available prey. The different feeding responses of these 2 co-occurring species are discussed with reference to resource partitioning.},

abstract = {We compared growth in a domesticated strain of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), that had been selected for rapid growth over 16 generations, to that of its hatchery-origin unselected parental stock. Fish were spawned on the same date and incubated under similar conditions. First feeding fry were fed to satiation and then were fed a commercial salmon feed at two ration levels, either to satiation or on a fixed ration from the size at which the smallest fish could accept a 1-mm pellet (domesticated 0.65??g, hatchery 0.96??g). The domesticated fish outperformed unselected fish by growing faster and to a larger size, ingesting a greater amount of feed when fed to satiation, and exhibiting greater efficiency in feed conversion. When fed to satiation, domesticated fish ingested 53{\%} more feed and gained 78{\%} more weight compared to unselected fish. The selected fish also appeared to utilize dietary lipids for energy while sparing protein for growth, while unselected fish deposited dietary lipids as body fat. These results indicate that selection over 16 generations for growth also resulted in changes in feed efficiency and energy allocation. Understanding the mechanisms underlying improved growth will aid future selection studies by identifying multiple targets of selection that contribute most to growth.},

                        +-ATPase activity, plasma chloride levels and survival in seawater. Overall, smolts from the wild strain were better able to tolerate transfer to seawater than smolts from the hatchery strain. A delay in the osmotic disturbance and a prolonged period of osmotic stress were observed at the low temperature. Circulating GH levels increased transiently in all groups during the first 12-48 h in seawater and long-term GH levels were positively correlated with seawater temperature. Growth rates were influenced by temperature and strain, with the farmed smolts showing a higher growth than the wild smolts. Food Conversion Efficiency (FCE) was higher in smolts from the farmed strain, whereas no differences in daily food consumption were observed. Optimum temperature for FCE was calculated to be 10.5°C, whereas the optimal temperature for growth in seawater was calculated to be 13.0°C. We suggest that the observed differences in seawater tolerance, growth and food conversion probably are genetic and may reflect the fact that the hatchery fish have been bred for rapid growth for several generations. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

We present a Globigerinoides ruber ??18O record from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1208 (Kuroshio Current Extension; KCE). This exclusively (sub)tropical foraminifer, a summer/fall mixed-layer dweller at the KCE, affords the first long (3.0Ma to 1.8Ma) orbital-scale (2.5-kyr time step) account of the sea surface in this area. The section's temperature-corrected benthic foraminiferal ??18O record constrains global changes in ice volume, yielding a ????18O record that primarily reflects summer/fall KCE hydrography (temperature and salinity). A 0.3??? decrease in ????18O values at 2.7Ma coincides with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, indicating as much as 1.5??C warming during the summer/fall to suggest that the subtropical North Pacific sea surface provided heat and moisture for expanding ice sheets. On the orbital scale, the 41-kyr cycle that dominates high-latitude climate is absent from the ????18O record, indicating a stable surface water hydrographic regime on this time scale. Rather, the ????18O record varies at and is coherent with the 19-kyr precessional component of the regional insolation curve, supporting a direct response to subtropical insolation and insensitivity to extra-regional forcing factors, such as ice sheets. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Overland2008,
abstract = {The many recent publications on regimes and shifts highlight the importance of decadal variability in understanding climate and ecosystems and their connectivity. This paper explores several issues in the application of regime concepts. Even the definition of regimes is unclear, as usage by different authors highlight: (1) displacement or shifts in timeseries, (2) underlying mechanisms, and (3) the distinction between external forcing and internal reorganization of ecosystems. Such differences arise, and cannot be easily resolved, because of the relatively short duration of available physical and biological timeseries, and the complexity of multivariate process in marine systems with unknown variables and relationships. Climate indices often show a rather Gaussian distribution of values with a single mean, rather than clearly separated discrete multiple states. These physical indices can be represented by a red noise long memory process, where the index can, in fact, deviate substantially from the long term mean for multiple years. If we consider changes in timeseries themselves, then climate variables for the North Pacific display shifts near 1977, 1989 and 1998. Recent variability suggests considerable uncertainty in the current state of the North Pacific. Biological variables often show a broader distribution of shifts over time, which is consistent with different types of responses to climate for different ecosystem elements and the importance of time lags in response to changes in physical forcing. Our current understanding of regime shifts is not a deterministic one, and while one can discuss amplitudes and mean duration of regimes, we cannot predict their precise timing other than to say that they will be a main feature of future climate and ecosystem states. While the authors believe that a single definition for regimes is currently not possible, the concept continues to be useful in moving the discussion of ecosystems away from the assumptions of single species and stationary processes.},

The behavior can be characterized by two drastic events. The first was the abrupt movement of the Kuroshio Front in December 1981, forming a bulge of the Kuroshio Water with a diameter of about 200 km. The bulge was cooled uniformly by an active air-sea interaction in winter, and became mixed with other waters. The analysis of the mixing process shows isopycnal mixing modifying almost the whole bulge water, and also a diapycnal mixing caused by an advection of the Kuroshio Water across the Kuroshio Front. The latter is closely connected with the second event, which started around 18 April and resulted in a warm-core ring detachment early in June. The formation process of the ring is described in detail by combining hydrographic data with the satellite data, and a hypothesis of the ring formation is given.},

At the completion of the feeding study, small or large fish which had been accustomed to 1FE or 1FL were sacrificed to model gastric evacuation of a single meal. The feeding study indicated that optimum to maximum weight gain and FCR in juvenile snapper can be achieved by feeding fish to apparent satiation twice per day. This regime equated to relative feed intakes of 36 or 47??g kg BW- 1 day- 1 for large or small snapper, respectively. In addition, there were no improvements in weight gain as a consequence of feeding a similar number of feeds (i.e. once, twice or four times) earlier in the day as opposed to later in the day. Size heterogeneity in both groups of snapper measured as the coefficient of variation in harvest weight (CVhw), was not affected by feeding regime, but smaller snapper recorded slightly higher CVhw (0.14) than larger juveniles (0.11). The gastric evacuation rates (GER) of small or large snapper fed a single meal proved to be similar (relative feed contentCombined = 2.733 ?? 0.195 ?? exp(- 0.139 ?? 0.013); R2 = 0.72), with approximately half the meal passed within 5??h and the whole meal cleared from the stomach within 16-20??h.

abstract = {Subduction, upwelling, and phytoplankton blooms are commonly observed features at oceanic fronts. This study isolates the role of vertical mixing for enhanced production and water mass subduction near fronts, considering the time-developing problem with a Semi-Geostrophic circulation model coupled to a planktonic ecosystem model. Our model results show that vertical mixing in the surface boundary layer strongly modifies the time evolution of the front and of its associated biology. Ageostrophic flows caused by the combined effects of confluence and vertical mixing enhance primary production on the less dense side and increase water mass subduction on the dense side of the front. Confluence alone results in the intensification of the front by the same advective response, while the phytoplankton bloom on the less dense side does not arise without vertical mixing. Vertical mixing alone slumps the front near the surface and provides weak subduction on the dense side and uplift of the isopycnals at the center of the front. We find that it is possible to sustain an isolated phytoplankton patch above the domed isopycnals at the center of the front with the nutrients supplied by the secondary circulations arising due to vertical mixing. These results suggest that the phytoplankton bloom and patches found on the less dense side of fronts in many field observations are likely caused by fine-scale along-isopycnal upwelling of nutrients forced by adiabatic confluence in the meander trough of fronts and further pumping and entrainment of nutrients by the secondary circulation due to vertical mixing. Isolated patches observed at the center of the front in many frontal surveys could be caused by secondary flows due to vertical mixing. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The light-saturated maximum value (PBmax) and initial slope ( ) of the photosynthesis- irradiance (P-E) curve were examined in a warm streamer, a cold streamer and a warm core ring off the Sanriku area in the subarctic western North Pacific Ocean during an ADEOS/OCTS Sanriku field campaign in early May 1997. Both PBmax and the ranges of temperate populations. A regional difference was apparent in PBmax: populations in the warm streamer tended to show higher value ranging between 1.92 and 4.74 mgC (mgChl a)–1h–1 than those in the cold streamer and the warm core ring (1.35– 2.87 mgC (mgChl a)–1h–1). A depth variation was also observed in streamer and the warm core ring: shallow populations tended to have lower populations. The depth variations in both PBmax and in both the warm than deep resulted in a lower light intensity of the light saturation in a deeper population than that of a shallower one. These depth- related variations in the P-E parameters were likely a manifestation of “shade-adaptation” of photosynthesis. Photoinhibition was not observed over in situ surface light intensity varying below ca 1600 mol photon m–2s–1. Water-column primary productivity was bio- optically estimated to be 233 to 949 mgC m–2d–1 using vertical distributions of the P-E parameters, chlorophyll a, phytoplankton light absorption and underwater irradiance. Applicability of surface data sets for estimation of water-column productivity is discussed.},

abstract = {This study investigated temporal variations in the vertical structure and water properties of a warm-core ring that migrated into the western subarctic gyre of the North Pacific, based on analyses of temperature and salinity data derived from two profiling floats, together with ship- board and satellite observation data. The floats were initially deployed into cold and fresh Oyashio water in September 2003, and were entrained into a warm-core ring in October 2003, remaining within the ring until detrainment in December 2004. Drastic cooling and freshening of the upper core water of the ring were observed during the above entrainment of the floats with cold and fresh water into the ring, whereas moderate variations in structure and water properties were observed during a quasi-isolated phase from November 2003 to November 2004 when the ring did not experience major interactions with ambient hydrographic features. The upper part of the core water (upper core), with relatively warm/saline water above 26.6 $\sigma$$\theta$, was under the influence of the atmosphere in winter via the formation of a deep mixed layer exceeding 300 dB, and had a prominent pycnostad below the seasonal pycnocline from spring to autumn. In contrast, the lower core, with relatively cold and fresh water below26.6 $\sigma$$\theta$, was not ventilated throughout the observation period. Isopycnal surfaces showed a shoaling trend of about 50 dB/year during the quasi-isolated phase, suggesting viscous decay over a timescale of several years. Markedly cold and thick water was also frequently observed within the ring, indicating the intrusion of water from the Sea of Okhotsk.},

abstract = {We investigated temporal and spatial variations in the zooplankton community structure in the Oyashio and Transition region of the subarctic western North Pacific from 1960 to 1999 using principal component analysis (PCA) and zooplankton samples from the historical Odate Collection. In particular, we examined the influence of Kuroshio and Oyashio decadal dynamics on geographical variations in the zooplankton community. The first principal component (PC1) closely represented the interannual variation in cold-water, large copepod species, while the second PC (PC2) represented the variation in warm-water, small copepod species. Using Rodionov's regime-shift method, we detected a significant increase in the PC score after 1976 and 1981 for PC1 and PC2, respectively. After the shift years, (1) warm-water species increased in the Transition zone, (2) the distribution center of the cold-water species shifted southward, and (3) copepod abundance and species diversity increased in the Transition zone as a result of (1) and (2). The timing of these shifts in the zooplankton community roughly coincided with the North Pacific climatic regime shift in 1976/1977. From the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, the southern boundary of the Oyashio shifted southward and increased geostrophic transport was observed in the Kuroshio, indicating spin up of the Kuroshio2013Oyashio system. Change in atmospheric circulation during the 1976/1977 regime shift is thought to have caused the spin up of these currents, which subsequently affected the regional zooplankton community through advective processes.},

abstract = {Consumption and growth rates of juvenile bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix increased with increasing temperature and decreased with increasing fish size in short-term (7 days) experi- ments. Salinity had no effect on growth or consumption rate in a short-term experiment. In a long-term (90 days) mesocosm experiment, consumption and growth rates declined with increasing body size. Predictive equations developed from short-term experiments did not adequately predict observed consumption rates in the mesocosm experiment. However, growth in the mesocosm experiment was similar to field growth. Also, mesocosm consumption rates and consumption rates calculated using field growth and mesocosm growth efficiencies were similar to published independent field estimates of consumption rate. Our results indicate that experiments to determine the effects of temperature and the allometry of body size on growth and consumption rates should be conducted over long time periods simulating field conditions. Juvenile bluefish have rapid growth and their individual cumulative consumption is large. This result suggests that bluefish may have a large effect on their prey populations. This effect has yet to be quantified},

abstract = {European anchovy larvae were sampled in June 2004 in the south-eastern part of the Bay of Biscay (limits: 48W, 468N). Larval distribution was analysed and compared with spawning dis- tribution in previous weeks. Patches of old larvae were found around the French and Cantabrian shelf (CS) edges and even in oceanic waters, far from the main spawning areas, whereas the young- est larvae appeared in the middle French shelf, associated with adult spawning locations. The analysis of environmental conditions showed significant differences from coastal to oceanic stations as well as in areas under the influence of river discharges. A principal component analysis carried out on temperature, stratification, chlorophyll a and plankton concentration distinguished five areas: Gironde, Northern French Shelf, Southern French Shelf, CS and Oceanic area. Growth and mor- tality rates were estimated for anchovy larvae in these contrasting areas. Advective processes due to dominant north-easterly winds during summer influence larval distribution in the Bay of Biscay after spawning. However higher food concentration on the shelf did not result in significant differ- ences in the growth rate. Mortality rates seem to be negatively related to larval size, although this effect may be partially due to advection. This is the first attempt to study the effect of environ- mental factors on anchovy larval distribution and mortality in the Bay of Biscay.},

A dense distribution of anticyclonic eddies with warm and saline core water occurred near the Kuroshio Extension, and the distribution extends northward--northeastward into the western subarctic gyre along the Japan and Kuril--Kamchatka trenches. Eddies with cold and fresh core water are found mainly around the Oyashio southward intrusions and farther north near the Kuril Islands. Based on the heat content anomaly integrated over 50--200 dbar, 85{\%}{\%} of the anticyclonic eddies within the study area (35°°--50°°N, 140°°--155°°E) have a warm and saline core and 15{\%}{\%} have a cold and fresh core. Warm and saline eddies around the Japan and Kuril--Kamchatka trenches have a double-core structure, with a cold and freshwater mass located below the warm core. The northward propagation of these eddies along the trench line results in a large northward heat (salinity) transport in the upper 400 dbar (250 dbar) and a negative salinity transport below 350 dbar. The lower core water is colder and fresher on isopycnal surfaces at around 26.70 $\sigma$$\sigma$$\theta$$\theta$ compared with the climatology. Given that the 26.70 $\sigma$$\sigma$$\theta$$\theta$ isopycnal surface does not outcrop in the open North Pacific, an alignment process is suggested to occur between the warm and saline and the cold and fresh anticyclonic eddies in the upper and intermediate layers, respectively.},

Fish were aged by growth increment counts on sagittal otoliths, presuming they were laid down with a daily periodicity. Age estimates ranged from 16 to 96 days, with a good consistency between readings. The hatch date distribution, back-calculated from the date of capture, was spread over a long period (April-February), with three main cohorts hatched in May, August and November. The instantaneous growth rate, calculated for the whole fish sample, was 0.68 mm/day. Nevertheless, the growth rate estimated for each of the main cohorts showed a seasonal trend, being higher in May and decreasing in August and November. The allometric relationship between otolith and fish size changed markedly during the transition from larval to juvenile stages, with a slight decrease of otolith growth rate after metamorphosis. The instantaneous total mortality rates of anchovy, calculated for each of the main cohorts, was lower in May and progressively increased in August and November cohorts, showing an opposite seasonal trend respect to the growth rate. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

A strong cooling is obtained at all depths until the mid-1970's, followed by a sustained warming over ???30 years. Strong interannual fluctuations are superimposed on this slow evolution. The fluctuations are intensified at the surface and are weakest at ???500 m. A good agreement is found between the observed and simulated temperatures, in terms of mean values, interannual variability and time correlations. Only the decadal trend is significantly underestimated in the simulation. A comparison to satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data over the last 20 years is also presented. The first mode of interannual variability exhibits a quasi-uniform structure and is related to the inverse winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Regarding the vertical structure, most cool and warm anomalies are generated at the surface, with the strongest ones penetrating down to 700 m and lasting up to 5 years. The complete heat budget from 1965 to 2004 is presented, including the contributions of vertical transport, freshwater flux and surface elevation. Interannual anomalies are mainly generated by the surface heat flux, while oceanic transports may become more important at longer time scales. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Herring (Clupea harengus) migrations tend to remain constant over periods of several years or even decades, despite environmental variation. When a migration pattern is changed, apparently in response to an environmental stimulus, the change in migratory behavior sometimes lasts longer than the environmental stimulus itself. This paper reviews evidence that the response of herring to environmental change is restrained by conservatism. Herring apparently develop certain migratory habits during the early stage of adult life and tend to adhere to these habits for life, even when the environment changes. Two elements of conservatism are distinguished: the formation of habits within one generation, and the transfer of habits between generations. A number of case studies on North Sea herring and Norwegian spring spawning herring are reviewed in order to find evidence for habit formation and tradition in the migrations of these populations. By eliminating the possibility that homing to spawning, wintering and feeding grounds is due to innate behavior or environmental constraints, it is shown that the return of these fish to the same areas each year is most likely a form of learned behavior. In many cases, new year-classes adopt the same migration pattern as their predecessors, which is explained by the social transfer of habits from old herring to young ones. A change of migration pattern is usually initiated by a recruiting year-class that lacks the "guidance" of older herring at the time it has to start its first migration. This may be the effect of a special environmental condition that affects the distribution of the recruiting age group more than that of the adult stock component, and thereby results in a separation of the two stock components. After the recruiting year-class has adopted the new migration route, it tends to repeat it in subsequent years. The new migration thus becomes habitual. Subsequent generations may copy the migration and continue this behavior even after the original environmental cause has disappeared.},

The model ring is initialized with an axisymmetric Gaussian-type anticyclonic eddy placing far from the coastal boundary to allow the ring to freely propagate towards the wall and shelf/slope. The ring initially propagates steadily to the southwest at about 3 km/day under the combined planetary ?? and nonlinear effects. When colliding with a wall, the ring adjusts into a 'D' shape and moves poleward under primarily the image effect. When colliding with a shelf and slope, the ring however becomes stalled and bounces on and off the shelf/slope with little net movement. Small cyclones marked by strong upwelling are generated near the shelfbreak. Cyclones and anticyclones also are spawned at the periphery of the ring.

Data on sea surface temperatures (SST) were combined with the analyses of patterns of eggs of plankton collected on the five cruises carried out from 1990 through 1994, during the spawning season of the Northern anchovy. The principal spawning area of this species is between the northern point of Angel de la Guarda Island and similar to 30 miles south of Tiburon Island, and the whole breadth of the Gulf of California. On the western coast of California, the Northern anchovy spawn in water temperatures between 11.5 and 17 degrees C, while in the Gulf of California, they prefer to spawn in water temperatures between 15 and 17 degrees C. From the satellite images, one could relate the patterns of water masses and temperature fronts to the distribution and abundance of anchovy eggs, as well as know their interannual variability.},

These three water masses are linked to three different current systems: the Norwegian Coastal Current, the Atlantic Current, and the Arctic Current. This paper gives a brief description of these current systems and their related water masses. Vertical stratification of the different water masses is emphasised since this is important for primary production. Climatic variability is determined by the properties and the activity of the inflowing Atlantic Water Current activity variations may be explained by external forcing, but may also be a result of processes taking place in the Barents Sea itself. The climatic fluctuations have a significant effect on the ice conditions. which in turn influence the biological production in the northern Barents Sea.},

abstract = {Most reports on the distribution of spawning areas of sardine (Sardinops sagax) in the northern Benguela originate from the 1970s and 1980s. The northern Benguela system was in a high upwelling regime during those decades. Since the early 1990s upwelling favourable winds have decreased and a trend of increasing sea surface temperature (SST) has been observed. Changes in the structure of sardine stock in the northern Benguela have been observed and it has been suggested that a reduced biomass and changes in stock structure has led to decreased spawning in the favourable southern locations, thus preventing a recovery of the sardine stock. The present paper on the contrary shows that there has been a shift in spawning location from the less favourable northern areas in the early 1980s to spawning areas further south in the 2000s. Thus, the failure of the northern Benguela sardine stock to recover since its collapse in the late 1960s cannot be explained by spawning in less favourable areas. The shift in preferred spawning location to more southern areas since the 1980s was to be expected with a general warming of the northern Benguela system. Alternative explanations for the failure of the sardine stock to recover such as a reduction in average length as well as length at 50{\%} maturity, leading to a reduction in reproductive output, increased predation pressure, and increased low oxygen waters are proposed.},

abstract = {The information collected from a European Union funded project on the 'Distribution Biology and Biomass Estimates of the Sicilian Channel Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus)' was used to analyse the linkage between the general circulation pattern of the Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS) and the reproductive strategy of the Sicilian Channel anchovy. The main spawning ground is located in the NW region of the southern Sicilian coast. This region is a stable area of low current produced by the impingement towards the coast of the AIS and its bifurcation into two branches. The main branch heads towards the SE end of the Sicilian coast (Cape Passero) acting as a transport mechanism for the anchovy eggs and larvae. Along the AIS trajectory, there is a density front to the left of the current, facing downstream. This front is a consequence of the shoreward sloping of isopycnals that maintains the geostrophic flow, facilitating the mixing of deeper waters with surface layers and fertilization of coastal waters. The front enhances primary production assuring food availability for anchovy larvae during their advection by the AIS. The highest concentrations of larval anchovy were found off the SE Sicilian coast, in the area off Cape Passero. The greater average sizes of larvae found in this region, and their estimated age, support the evidence of advection by the AIS. The hydrographic features observed in this area, such as the existence of a well-defined cyclonic vortex, implies the existence of upwelling in its centre, providing a suitable environment for sustained enhanced rates of primary production and allowing the larval population to maintain their relative position. This retention area is conceived as favourable for providing the necessary feeding conditions. The data acquired from a survey carried out to evaluate the anchovy recruitment strength confirm that larvae reach the juvenile stage in the south-eastern coast of Sicily, since most of the young-of-the-year anchovy were located in the Cape Passero region.},

abstract = {The present study furnishes conclusive evidence for the existence of latitudinal differences in the duration of anchovy spawning related to temperature cycle and hydrographic features; 2 main spawning areas were found, one off northern and another off southern Catalonia (NW Mediterranean, NE Spain). Total egg production was similar in the 2 spawning areas and even somewhat higher in the northern area, where the spawning cycle was shorter (ca 2 mo). The areas of highest egg abundance were located relatively far offshore, between 10 and 30 miles from the coast, spanning a very broad range of bottom depths, from 50 to 1000 m. The presence of a shelf-slope front of variable intensity running along the entire coast (Font et al. 1988) suggests that anchovy take advantage of the productivity associated with the front for reproductive purposes, particularly since the front is the most important enrichment phenomenon in the region during summer, the time of maximum spawning (Estrada {\&} Margalef 1988). In addition, the distribution of spawning activity brings to light its association with the zones of influence of the outflows of 2 large rivers, the Rhone and the Ebro. On the whole, the reproductive behaviour of Engraulis encrasicolus in the Northwestern Mediterranean takes advantage of the most favourable conditions to ensure the success of early life stages in a region in which enrichment phenomena are more limited than those described for other clupeoid species.},

@article{Mcbride2013,
abstract = {Oogenesis in fishes follows a universal plan; yet, due to differences in the synchrony and rate of egg development, spawning frequency varies from daily to once in a lifetime. Some species spawn and feed in separate areas, during different seasons, by storing energy and drawing on it later for reproduction (i.e. capital breeding). Other species spawn using energy acquired locally, throughout a prolonged spawning season, allocating energy directly to reproduction (i.e. income breeding). Capital breeders tend to ovulate all at once and are more likely to be distributed at boreal latitudes. Income breeding allows small fish to overcome allometric constraints on egg production. Income breeders can recover more quickly when good-feeding conditions are re-established, which is a benefit to adults regarding bet-hedging spawning strategies. Many species exhibit mixed capital- and income-breeding patterns. An individual's position along this capital-income continuum may shift with ontogeny or in relation to environmental conditions, so breeding patterns are a conditional reproductive strategy. Poor-feeding environments can lead to delayed maturation, skipped spawning, fewer spawning events per season or fewer eggs produced per event. In a few cases, variations in feeding environments appear to affect recruitment variability. These flexible processes of energy acquisition and allocation allow females to prioritize their own condition over their propagules' condition at any given spawning opportunity, thereby investing energy cautiously to maximize lifetime reproductive value. These findings have implications for temporal and spatial sampling designs, for measurement and interpretation of fecundity, and for interpreting fishery and ecosystem assessments.},

abstract = {Eastern tropical Pacific Ocean waters lie at the eastern end of a basin-wide equatorial current system, between two large subtropical gyres and at the terminus of two eastern boundary currents. Descriptions and interpretations of surface, pycnocline, intermediate and deep waters in the region are reviewed. Spatial and temporal patterns are discussed using (1) maps of surface temperature, salinity, and nutrients (phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite), and thermocline and mixed layer parameters, and (2) meridional and zonal sections of temperature, salinity, potential density, oxygen, and nutrients. These patterns were derived from World Ocean Database observations by an ocean interpolation algorithm: loess-weighted observations were projected onto quadratic functions of spatial coordinates while simultaneously fitting annual and semiannual harmonics and the Southern Oscillation Index to account for interannual variability. Contrasts between the equatorial cold tongue and the eastern Pacific warm pool are evident in all the hydrographic parameters. Annual cycles and ENSO (El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation) variability are of similar amplitude in the eastern tropical Pacific, however, there are important regional differences in relative variability at these time scales. Unique characteristics of the eastern tropical Pacific are discussed: the strong and shallow pycnocline, the pronounced oxygen minimum layer, and the Costa Rica Dome.

abstract = {Samples of Engraulis encrasicolus from the western Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic spawning groups were examined by protein electrophoresis to investigate their relevance in the genetic structure of European anchovy, and how they fit with the current defi- nition of anchovy fisheries. Samples from an earlier study were also included in the analyses to assess the temporal genetic stability of spawning groups. Gene diversity analysis indicated greater differentiation between spawning groups within seas (GRS = 0.046) than between seas (GSEA = 0.022), and lesser differentiation between locations within spawning groups (GLR = 0.003), as well as genetic stability of spawning groups (GCL = 0.002). The six spawning groups apparently involved three genetic units according to STRUCTURE results, and the results of other analyses also suggested genetic differences between the two Atlantic spawning groups. The genetic substructure detected within the Atlantic agrees with the spawning groups, but does not fit easily with ICES Subdivisions. Based on these results, a revision of the current anchovy management in both Alboran Sea and Bay of Biscay areas is suggested.},

abstract = {The ability to abstract and symbolize ideas and knowledge as simplified schematic constructs is an important element of scientific creativity and communication. Availability of such generalized symbolic constructs may be particularly important when addressing a complex adaptive system such as a marine ecosystem. Various examples have appeared in the climate-fisheries literature, each more or less effectively integrating hypothesized effects of several interacting environmental and/or biological processes in controlling population dynamics of exploited fish species. A selection of these are herein presented and reviewed, including match-mismatch, connectivity, school trap, loopholes, ocean triads, stable ocean hypothesis, several classes of nonlinear feedback loops (e.g., 'P2P', school-mix feedback, predator pit), as well as several prominent large-scale integrative climatic index series (SOI, NAO, PDO). The importance of considering the potential for adaptation and/or rapid evolution is stressed. An argument is offered for the potential utility of such widely recognizable schematic concepts in offering relatively well-understood, fairly well-defined frameworks for comparative identification and elaboration of important mechanistic linkages between climate variability and fishery dynamics, as well as in easing effective communication among scientists from different regions and disciplinary backgrounds. Certain difficulties in the application of the comparative method are discussed. It is suggested that alleviation of such difficulties may be one of the major benefits of international collaborative programs such as GLOBEC and IMBER. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In October 2004, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES) sponsored a symposium to consider "Mechanisms that regulate North Pacific ecosystems: Bottom up, top down, or something else?" It sought to examine how marine populations, particularly the upper-trophic-level species, are regulated and to understand how energy flows through marine ecosystems. This introductory essay examines aspects of control mechanisms in pelagic marine ecosystems and some of the issues discussed during the symposium and in the 11 papers that were selected for this special issue. At global scales, the greatest biomass of fishes, seabirds and marine mammals tends to occur in regions of the world ocean with high primary production, e.g., the sub-arctic seas and up-welling regions of continental shelves. These large-scale animal distribution patterns are driven by food availability, not the absence of predators. At regional scales however, it is likely that current predation or past predation events have shaped local distributions, at least in marine birds and pinnipeds. Wasp-waist control occurs when one of the intermediate trophic levels is dominated by a single species, as occurs with small pelagic fishes of the world's up-welling zones. Processes in these ecosystems may have features that result in a switch from bottom-up to top-down control. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Small pelagic fish species like anchovy or sardines are of high ecological and economical importance. As marine food webs are fished down, these small pelagics tend to be more exploited and overfished. It is not yet very well known what the possible effects of their collapse can be, therefore there is an urgent need to outline a theoretical framework for understanding their dynamics. These fish occupy very special position in food webs, ensuring energy transfer between species lower and higher levels, while forming narrow "wasp-waists" poor in number of species (but very abundant). Our purpose was to quantify the interaction structure of model food webs of equal complexity but different levels of "wasp-waistedness". We analysed the topological properties of the webs by characterising every direct and indirect interactions between individual species, as well as by assessing the relative positional importance of each species in each web. We found that (1) the shorter the interaction pathways considered, the weaker the predictive power of node degree for positional importance, (2) the importance of species varies more in wasp-waist food webs, (3) if longer indirect chain effects are considered, indirect effects can well be stronger than direct ones, (4) interactions between coexisting wasp-waist species are stronger than the average, and (5) the "self-regulatory" looping effects are also stronger for wasp-waist species. Based on the topological properties of the networks, our results describe constraints acting on the dynamical behaviour of wasp-waist ecosystems. We give explanations, from this viewpoint, for regime shifts in which one WW species replaces another, and for the unpredictable dynamics of these fish stocks. From a marine conservation viewpoint, we illustrate that as the abundance of wasp-waist species decreases, the architecture of energy flows becomes highly vulnerable and unreliable. We provide an approach for quantifying these structural changes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The recent failure of sardine catches off Galicia (NW Spain), an area where landings reached up to 100 thou- sand tonnes only a few years ago, may be explained by two possible hypotheses. The “depletion” hypothesis states that diminishing sardine catches were due to a decrease in stock biomass resulting from a combination of reduced recruitment and increased fishing mortality. The “change in distribution” hypothesis states that catch failure was due to a change in the distribution of the stock owing to environmental changes. Available information, based on direct observations from acoustic and ichthyplankton surveys and the fishery, was analysed. When the stock size is high, the spawning area of the sardine extends offshore in the Cantabrian Sea, and spreads along the continental shelf off northern Portugal. Moreover, adult fish undertake feeding migration towards Galician waters. This spawning behaviour results in a recruitment located mainly off Portugal. Low stock size causes a shrinkage in the distribution area throughout coastal waters and in the Cantabrian Sea, reaching the inner part of the Bay of Biscay. This process also affects the migration range and favours a higher retention in coastal waters of the early life stages (from eggs to recruits), which remain primarily in the same area where they were hatched. The lack of sardine in Galicia may be explained by a depletion process which affects both the feeding migration of adult fish and the recruitment occurrence off southern Galicia. This paper also analyses the dynamics of this stock in the context of a metapopulation. Taking this concept into consideration, we also examined the influence of the dynamics of each sub-population and the environmental conditions that might affect the success of the recruitment.},

abstract = {Many marine ecosystems exhibit a characteristic "wasp-waist" structure, where a single species, or at most several species, of small planktivorous fishes entirely dominate their trophic level. These species have complex life histories that result in radical variability that may propagate to both higher and lower trophic levels of the ecosystem. In addition, these populations have two key attributes: (1) they represent the lowest trophic level that is mobile, so they are capable of relocating their area of operation according to their own internal dynamics; (2) they may prey upon the early life stages of their predators, forming an unstable feedback loop in the trophic system that may, for example, precipitate abrupt regime shifts. Experience with the typical "boom-bust" dynamics of this type of population, and with populations that interact trophically with them, suggests a "predator pit" type of dynamics. This features a refuge from predation when abundance is very low, very destructive predation between an abundance level sufficient to attract interest from predators and an abundance level sufficient to satiate available predators, and, as abundance increases beyond this satiation point, decreasing specific predation mortality and population breakout. A simple formalism is developed to describe these dynamics. Examples of its application include (a) a hypothetical mechanism for progressive geographical habitat expansion at high biomass, (b) an explanation for the out-of-phase alternations of abundances of anchovies and sardines in many regional systems that appear to occur without substantial adverse interactions between the two species groups, and (c) an account of an interaction of environmental processes and fishery exploitation that caused a regime shift. The last is the example of the Baltic Sea, where the cod resource collapsed in concert with establishment of dominance of that ecosystem by the cod's 'wasp-waist" prey, herring and sprat. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During the 1930s and 1940s, Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax) supported an important fishery in Pacific Northwest waters, but after their population crashed in the mid-1950s, they were rarely observed in this region. Starting in the mid-1990s, sardines resumed migrating into Northwest waters to spawn and feed. Pacific sardines now support a relatively large purse seine fishery centered off the Columbia River. From 1994 to 1998, we identified the abundance and distribution of Pacific sardine eggs and larvae in Northwest waters. The highest egg densities were observed in June 1996. During all years, eggs were associated with surface temperatures between 14° and 15°C. From 1998 to 2004, surface-trawl surveys, primarily on the continental shelf, identified the temporal and spatial distribution and abundance patterns of juvenile and adult Pacific sardines. Adult sardines generally do not over-winter off the Northwest, but migrate north from California in the spring (May–June) when surface temperatures exceed 12°C. However, juvenile sardines over-winter in nearshore coastal waters. During most years, few 0-age juveniles were captured, indicating relatively poor spawning success; however, high densities of 0-age sardines were observed in fall of 2003 and 2004, indicating successful spawning. During the summer, sardines are most abundant on the shelf in cool ({\textless}16°C) and high salinity ({\textgreater}30 S) coastal waters, with their highest densities occurring in northern Oregon/Washington waters. Sardines are non-selective planktonic filter feeders; prey include copepods, euphausiids, and phytoplankton. Sardines are important prey of Northwest fishes, such as sharks, salmon, Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), and jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus).},

We conclude that both genera are monotypic and that the differences between populations of Sardinops in different current systems are not large enough to consider them distinct subspecies. Analysis of biochemical genetics information, fossil evidence, and present and paleo-climatic conditions suggests that Sardinops did not achieve its present distribution until the Pleistocene and that westward exchange of sardines via the northern and southern west wind drift regions is possible with present climatic conditions. Transequator exchange appears to be possible only during glacial maxima and only in the eastern tropical Pacific.},

abstract = {The relationship between anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) recruitment in the Bay of Biscay and environmental variables during their planktonic phase (March to July) was investigated from 1986 to 1997. Meteorological variables (wind and temperature) are forcing effects on the sea, but they are not thought to be processes that govern larval survival directly. Food-web dynamics are believed to be more closely linked to larval survival and are related to the physical vertical water column structure. Therefore, we used a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model to characterize three major physical mesoscale processes affecting vertical structure in south-cast Biscay: stratification, upwelling and river plume extent. Indices were estimated from the model outputs to characterize and quantify the space/ time evolution of these structures during the period March to July. A multiple linear regression analysis was then used to analyse hierarchy in the explanatory power of the physical indices. Coastal upwelling and shelf stratification breakdown indices were the most significant explanatory variables, with positive and negative effect on recruitment, respectively. A model with these two indices explains 75{\%} of the recruitment variability of anchovy observed in the period 1987-96.},

abstract = {Regimes of high abundance of sardine (Sardinops sagax and Sardina pilchardus) have alternated with regimes of high abundance of anchovy (Engraulis spp.) in each of the five regions of the world where these taxa co-occur and have been extensively fished. When one taxon has been plentiful, the other has usually been at a reduced level of abundance, and vice versa. Changes in the four heavily fished regions that support S. sagax-the Japanese, Californian, Humboldt, and Benguela systems-from a regime dominated by one taxon to a high level of abundance of the other have occurred more or less simultaneously. In the Pacific Ocean, sardines have tended to increase during periods of increasing global air and sea temperatures and anchovies to decrease. The Japanese system is dominated by sardines to a greater extent than the other systems, and sardines off Japan appear to increase as the Kuroshio Current cools. At the eastern edge of the Pacific Ocean, sardines colonize cooler areas during periods of warming. The Benguela system is out of phase with the three Pacific systems. The four systems all appeared to be in a state of flux in the 1980s. Increased abundance of the subdominant taxon is often one of the first signs of change. Sardines are relatively sedentary in refuge areas when scarce but change behavior to become highly migratory and colonize cooler areas when abundant. Anchovies, by contrast, expand around a fixed geographic center.},

abstract = {To date, there are numerous transport simulation studies demonstrating the relevance of the hydrodynamics for the advection, dispersion and recruitment of early stages of marine organisms. However, the lack of data has conditioned the use of realistic locations for the model setup and configuration in transport studies. This work (I) demonstrates the key role played by the use of the realistic initial position of the eggs of small pelagic fishes in the analysis of late-larval recruitment in coastal nursery areas and (II) provides a general solution for deriving future egg positions and abundances from adult biomass obtained from acoustic surveys and available fecundity data. Using European anchovy in the NW Mediterranean as a case study, we first analyzed the impact of the initial location, timing, egg buoyancy and diel vertical migration of larvae on the potential late-larval recruitment to coastal areas. The results suggested that prior knowledge of the initial spawning grounds may substantially affect the estimates of potential recruitment. We then integrated biological and acoustics-derived data (the biomass and size structure, sex ratio, a weight-batch fecundity model, mean weight, number of fish and mean spawning) to build a predictive model for interannual egg production. This model was satisfactorily contrasted with field data for two years obtained with the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM). We discuss our results in the context of the fluctuations of European anchovy egg abundance from 2003 through 2010 in the NW Mediterranean and in terms of the potential applicability of the acoustics-based spatial predictive egg production model.},

We use a cross-disciplinary approach combining genetics, transport modelling, survey time series analyses and physical oceanographic modelling to investigate 3 hypotheses on the reasons for this change. Evidence from connectivity studies suggests that the population of North Sea anchovy is separate from that in the Bay of Biscay. The recruitment pulses observed in survey data fit a life cycle which includes spawning in early summer and larval development in late summer. This also supports the concept of population expansion originating from local remnant population(s). In terms of growth physiology, suitable thermal windows have expanded, making conditions more favourable for life cycle closure and population persistence/productivity. In addition to the increased frequency of warm summers, which favour larvae and juvenile growth, the decrease in the number of severe winters is also likely to improve overwinter survival. Overall, the evidence supports the hypothesis that the increase in anchovy abundance originated from the improved productivity of existing populations. This increase was associated with an expansion in thermal habitats and is probably not due to a northward shift in the distribution of southern conspecifics.},

abstract = {A number of scientific papers in the last few years singled out the influence of environmental conditions on the spatial distribution of fish species, highlighting the need for the fisheries scientific community to investigate, besides biomass estimates, also the habitat selection of commercially important fish species. The Mediterranean Sea, although generally oligotrophic, is characterized by high habitat variability and represents an ideal study area to investigate the adaptive behavior of small pelagics under different environmental conditions. In this study the habitat selection of European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and European sardine Sardina pilchardus is analyzed in two areas of the Mediterranean Sea that largely differentiate in terms of environmental regimes: the Strait of Sicily and the North Aegean Sea. A number of environmental parameters were used to investigate factors influencing anchovy and sardine habitat selection. Acoustic surveys data, collected during the summer period 2002-2010, were used for this purpose. The quotient analysis was used to identify the association between high density values and environmental variables; it was applied to the entire dataset in each area in order to identify similarities or differences in the "mean" spatial behavioral pattern for each species. Principal component analysis was applied to selected environmental variables in order to identify those environmental regimes which drive each of the two ecosystems. The analysis revealed the effect of food availability along with bottom depth selection on the spatial distribution of both species. Furthermore PCA results highlighted that observed selectivity for shallower waters is mainly associated to specific environmental processes that locally increase productivity. The common trends in habitat selection of the two species, as observed in the two regions although they present marked differences in hydrodynamics, seem to be driven by the oligotrophic character of the study areas, highlighting the role of areas where the local environmental regimes meet 'the ocean triad hypothesis'.},

abstract = {The South African pelagic resources have been monitored acoustically since 1983. The results of these surveys are currently used to determine catch limits for anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax. Two main surveys are conducted annually, in winter to determine the strength of the year's recruitment and in summer to estimate the size of the adult stock. The results of the surveys conducted between 1990 and 1997 are presented and discussed in the context of the time-series of stock abundance. Distribution patterns, size structure and biomass levels are related to general trends in the life-history strategies of anchovy and sardine, as well as the major environmental features in the southern Benguela in the 1990s. The biomass of adult anchovy appears to be driven largely by the strength of the early recruitment, corresponding to fish spawned in the first half of the summer spawning season. The biomass of adult sardine, however, is better explained on the basis of the biomass of 2-year-old and older fish in the previous year's survey. Anchovy tend to move east with age, whereas sardine appear to move both north, along the south African west coast, and east with increasing age.},

abstract = {Proximate factors of the intraspecific variation in molluscan shell morphology have long received attention in biology. The intertidal gastropod Monetaria annulus (Mollusca; Gastropoda; Cypraeidae) is particularly suitable for the study of variation in body size, because this species is a determinate grower in the sense that soft-body size shows no further increase after the juvenile stage. Cross-sectional field surveys on post-juvenile individuals have indicated that the mean body size varies widely among populations and is larger in females than in males within populations. To examine whether these patterns are due to genetic differences, we conducted a common-garden rearing experiment with juvenile individuals collected from two populations on Okinawa Island. After adjusting for among-individual differences in initial degree of development, statistical analyses revealed that this species exhibits female-biased sexual size dimorphism mediated by a longer development time rather than by faster growth rates in females. Although wild individuals show a remarkable size difference between populations, no size difference was found between the populations in the individuals reared in a common-garden condition. This result suggests that the among-population size difference does not have a genetic basis and is caused by phenotypic plasticity based on environmental heterogeneity among habitats.},

abstract = {Direct ageing of fish can be a laborious and expensive task when age estimates from a large population are required, and often involves a degree of subjectivity. This study examined the application of general and generalized linear models that predict the age of fish from a range of efficiently and objectively measured covariates. The data sampled were from yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis (Sparidae) (Owen, 1853)) and sand whiting (Sillago ciliata (Sillaginidae) Cuvier, 1829) populations from New South Wales, Australia. The covariates evaluated in the models were fish length, otolith weight, sex and location (the estuary from which the fish were sampled). Akaike Information Criteria were used for model selection and residual plots of the final models revealed a satisfactory fit to the observations. The best fitting model for each species included all covariates. An additional investigation considered whether general and generalized linear models that predict age from two different categories of biometric information outperform age-length keys with respect to subsequent estimates of total mortality from catch-curve analysis. The two categories of biometric information differed in the ease and cost with which the information could be collected. The first category only included fish length and location as covariates, whilst the second category also included otolith weight and sex. It was found that traditional age-length keys outperformed the predictive models that estimated age from only fish length and location, because the results from the models were prone to significant bias. However, when otolith weight and sex were added as covariates to the predictive models, some of them, including a generalized linear model with a Poisson-distributed response variable, performed similarly to the age-length key. Given that otolith weight and the sex of fish are cheaper to quantify than age from a sectioned otolith in many situations, general or generalized linear models may represent a cheaper and faster method of estimating mortality compared to age-length keys. Such models can also easily incorporate the influence of spatial, temporal and demographic variation. Crown Copyright ?? 2007.},

abstract = {Colonial seabirds often breed in large aggregations. These individuals can be exposed to parasitism by the tick Ixodes uriae, but little is known about the circulation of pathogens carried by this ectoparasite, including Lyme disease Borrelia. Here we investigated the prevalence of antibodies (Ab) against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in seabird species sampled at eight locations across the North Atlantic. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests, we found that the prevalence of anti-Borrelia Ab in adult seabirds was 39.6{\%} on average (over 444 individuals), but that it varied among colonies and species. Common guillemots showed higher seroprevalence (77.1{\%}+/-5.9) than black-legged kittiwakes (18.6{\%}+/-6.7) and Atlantic puffins (22.6{\%}+/-6.3). Immunoblot-banding patterns of positive individuals, reflecting the variability of Borrelia antigens against which Ab were produced, also differed among locations and species, and did not tightly match the prevalence of Borrelia phylogroups previously identified in ticks collected from the same host individuals. These results represent the first report of the widespread prevalence of Ab against Borrelia within an assemblage of seabird species and demonstrate that Borrelia is an integrated aspect in the interaction between seabirds and ticks. More detailed studies on the dynamics of Borrelia within and among seabird species at different spatial scales will now be required to better understand the implications of this interaction for seabird ecology and the epidemiology of Lyme disease.},

abstract = {The 29 estimators of natural mortality (M) that have been proposed for ‘informa- tion-limited' fisheries are reviewed, together with a new alternative presented here. Each is applied to 13 example populations for which well-founded estimates are available of both M and the estimators' parameters. None of the 30 can provide accurate estimates for every species, and none appears sufficiently precise for use in analytical stock assessments, while several perform so poorly as to have no practi- cal utility. If the growth coefficient K has been reliably estimated, either M = 1.5 K or Pauly's long-established estimator can provide useful estimates of M, but they fail with species that have long adult lives after swift juvenile growth, with those that never reach their asymptotic lengths and with species that otherwise deviate from archetypal teleost life histories. If a pre-exploitation maximum observed age (Tmax) can be established, M can be estimated for both teleosts and sharks using M = 4.3/Tmax but that seriously underestimates when the effective sample size (ne) is large and overestimates with species showing pronounced senescence. The new estimator presented here addresses ne but is upset by even mild senescence. Some estimators of M-at-size, particularly ones recently advanced by Gislason et al. and Charnov et al., also show promise but require further examination. It is recom- mended that fisheries scientists measure M by more advanced methods whenever possible. If ‘information-limited' estimators must be used, their uncertainties should be acknowledged and their errors propagated into management advice.},

abstract = {We examined variability in growth rate during the larval stage of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in response to physical and biological environmental factors in 2005 and 2006. The onset of spring upwelling was anomalously delayed by 2–3 months until mid-July in 2005; in contrast, spring upwelling in 2006 began as a normal year in the northern California Current. Larval and early juvenile E. mordax were collected in August, September, and October off the coast of Oregon and Washington. Hatch dates ranged from May to September, with peaks in June and August in 2005 and a peak in July in 2006, based on the number of otolith daily increments. Back-calculated body length-at-age in the June 2005 hatch cohort was significantly smaller than in the August 2005 cohort, which had comparable growth to the July 2006 cohort. Standardized otolith daily increment widths as a proxy for seasonal variability in somatic growth rates in 2005 were negative until late July and then changed to positive with intensification of upwelling. The standardized increment width was a positive function of biomass of chlorophyll a concentration, and neritic cold-water and oceanic subarctic copepod species sampled biweekly off Newport, Oregon. Our results suggest that delayed upwelling in 2005 resulted in low food availability and, consequently, reduced E. mordax larval growth rate in early summer, but once upwelling began in July, high food availability enhanced larval growth rate to that typical of a normal upwelling year (e.g., 2006) in the northern California Current.},

@article{Cowan1996,
abstract = {Twenty-day simulations of responses by a larval fish cohort were investigated with an individual-based model of predation by ctenophore, medusa, and planktivorous fish predators. Results indicate that the relationship between larval size and vulnerability to predation was generally dome-shaped for invertebrate predators and could be dome-shaped for fish predators if they foraged optimally by size, and depended upon attributes of both predators and larval fish prey. For the predators that did not forage optimally, cohort-specific mortality generally decreased as the mean length of larvae in a cohort increased, but bigger or faster-growing larvae within a cohort were not always most likely to survive. Until larvae grew through a window of vulnerability and reached a threshold length when susceptibility to the predators decreased more rapidly with larval length than encounter rate increased, mean length or growth rate of surviving larvae on each day was slightly lower, or not different from those that died in most of the simulations. After the threshold length was reached, predators began to catch smaller larvae, which resulted in larger survivors. The time necessary to grow through the window and reach the threshold length depended on growth rate of the larvae, size of the predators, and the variance structure of these parameters. These results indicate that size and growth rate of fish larvae are partially decoupled by the predation process and, ultimately, act differentially to determine cohort survival rate, although both may be most important after larvae have reached the threshold length. In these simulations, the threshold length was reached after a significant portion (5699{\%}) of total larval mortality had occurred; time to reach the threshold was generally shorter for the faster growing cohorts. Initially, both fast- and slow-growing individuals within a larval cohort differed little in size and, therefore, were nearly equally vulnerable to predation. However, reduced risk of predation occurred when all members of a cohort had reached the threshold length, which suggests that mean growth rate of individuals within a cohort, not their size, is probably the more important parameter affecting cumulative mortality, especially when the rate is high. We propose that characteristics of larval survivors may be more influenced by attributes of the predators to which they were exposed in early life, rather than by their initial status within a cohort with respect to length at hatching and potential growth rate.},

abstract = {The hydrographic structure of a quasi-stationary jet separated from the Kuroshio Extension, a phenomenon that possibly leads to deepening of the winter mixed layer, is revealed via intensive observations using a conductivity–temperature–depth profiler and a ship-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) carried out in September 2009. Data collected from profiling floats set to drift isopycnal layers and time series of sea surface buoys and satellite altimeters were also analyzed to understand the continuity, water characteristics, and time variation of the jet. Although the flow field was complex due to disturbances such as energetic eddies, the jet transported subtropical water to the downstream (northeastern) observation region in a layer shallower than 400 dbar and its highest velocity was concentrated in the mid- and deep layers (≤0.30 m s−1 at the sea surface and ≥0.05 m s−1 at 800-m depth). The velocity axes of the jet detected from the satellite data corresponded to those detected through analysis of the ADCP data, and the intensity of the jet at the sea surface varies over interannual-to-decadal time scales. Part of the interannual-to-decadal variation in the velocity field of the jet is controlled by the dynamic state of the Kuroshio Extension and is correlated with that of the Kuroshio Extension latitude (linear correlation coefficient r {\~{}} 0.67). The relationship between these variations can be interpreted qualitatively as being responsible for the inertial streamers that separate from the crests of meanders of the Kuroshio Extension to the jet region due to the large steering effect.},

abstract = {Surface flow jets and associated sea surface temperature (SST) distribution are investigated in the northwestern North Pacific, using satellite-derived surface currents and SST data that can resolve fine spatial scale structure. The combined use of these data reveals warm tongue phenomena driven by surface geostrophic jets, which extend northeastward in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition area. They roughly coincide with the Subarctic Front (SAF) defined as the 4?C isotherm at 100 m depth. The phenomena appear throughout the year with seasonal cycles, which do not correspond with that of the subarctic North Pacific. Their positions are affected by bottom topography so that their quasi-stationary and consistent features are suggested. Thus it is implied that these jets play an important role in transporting warm waters toward the subarctic region. The time series of SST and current fields describe the jets' year-to-year variability involving some changes in strength and connections with the Kuroshio Extension (KE), and demonstrate the effects of advection by the jets on SST fields. When KE extends northward at its crests for 1999–2002, one of the jets along SAF simultaneously strengthens, resulting in high SST region directly over and along the south side of the jet. Hydrographic data show warm, saline water intrusions along the jets. Their mean fields also reveal that these jets are vertically well-developed, forming a boundary between the subtropical and subarctic gyres in the North Pacific.},

abstract = {Air-sea coupled variability is investigated in this study by focusing on the observed sea surface temperature signals in the Kuroshio Extension (KE) region of 32 degrees-38 degrees N and 142 degrees E-180 degrees. In this region, both the oceanic circulation variability and the heat exchange variability across the air-sea interface are the largest in the midlatitude North Pacific. SST variability in the KE region has a dominant time scale of similar to 10 yr and this decadal variation is caused largely by the regional, wind-induced sea surface height changes that represent the lateral migration and strengthening/weakening of the KE jet. The importance of the air-sea coupling in influencing KE jet is explored by dividing the large-scale wind forcing into those associated with the intrinsic atmospheric variability and those induced by the SST changes in the KE region. The latter signals are extracted from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data using the lagged correlation analysis. In the absence of the SST feedback, the intrinsic atmospheric forcing enhances the decadal and longer time-scale SST variance through oceanic advection but fails to capture the observed decadal spectral peak. When the SST feedback is present, a warm (cold) KE SST anomaly works to generate a positive (negative) wind stress curl in the eastern North Pacific basin, resulting in negative (positive) local sea surface height (SSH) anomalies through Ekman divergence (convergence). As these wind-forced SSH anomalies propagate into the KE region in the west, they shift the KE jet and alter the sign of the preexisting SST anomalies. Given the spatial pattern of the SST-induced wind stress curl forcing, the optimal coupling in the midlatitude North Pacific occurs at the period of similar to 10 yr, slightly longer than the basin-crossing time of the baroclinic Rossby waves along the KE latitude.},

The double strand PCR product purified were sequenced using direct sequencing method. Genetic distance values were estimated using the method of Kimra's 2-parameter. Results Highest mutation rate was observed in the D-loop among the analyzed regions of pilchards. Since D-loop was sequenced in order to identify the local population structure of pilchard, no obvious genetic differences were observed among the collected sites. Thus, single population structure is suggested in pilchard from coast of Japan.},

The average values of primary production and of production rate and food requirement of heterotrophic organisms were higher in summer than in other seasons. During the study period the biomass, production rate and food requirement of small heterotrophs (i.e. bacteria: BA; heterotrophic nanoflagellates: HNF; microzooplankton: MZ) were much higher than those of copepod secondary (CSP) and tertiary producers (CTP), indicating that the microbial food web was the main route of carbon flow from phytoplankton (PP) to CSP and CTP, rather than the grazing food chain. In particular, during summer and autumn the biomass of pico- and nano-size PP plus BA was greater than that of micro-size PP, suggesting the high prevalence of the microbial food web (pico-/nanophytoplankton/BA-HNF/MZ-copepods). During winter and spring, the biomass of micro-size PP was greater than that of pico- and nano-size PP plus BA, suggesting that the indirect route (microphytoplankton-MZ-copepods) probably prevailed, while the microbial food web might be important.},

abstract = {Winter mortality has been documented in a large number of freshwater fish populations, and a smaller, but increasing, number of marine and estuarine fishes. The impacted populations include a number of important North American and European resource species, yet the sources of winter mortality remain unidentified in most populations where it has been documented. Among the potential sources, thermal stress and starvation have received the most research attention. Other sources including predation and pathogens have significant impacts but have received insufficient attention to date. Designs of more recent laboratory experiments have reflected recognition of the potential for interactions among these co-occurring stressors. Geographic patterns in winter mortality are, in some cases, linked to latitudinal clines in winter severity and variability. However, for many freshwater species in particular, the effects of local community structure (predators and prey) may overwhelm latitudinal patterns. Marine (and estuarine) systems differ from freshwater systems in several aspects important to overwintering fishes, the most important being the lack of isolating barriers in the ocean. While open population boundaries allow fish to adopt migration strategies minimizing exposure to thermal stresses, they may retard rates of evolution to local environments. Geographic patterns in the occurrence and causes of winter mortality are ultimately determined by the interaction of regional and local factors. Winter mortality impacts population dynamics through episodic depressions in stock size and regulation of annual cohort strength. While the former tends to act in a density-independent manner, the latter can be density dependent, as most sources of mortality tend to select against the smallest members of the cohort and population. Most stock assessment and management regimes have yet to explicitly incorporate the variability in winter mortality. Potential management responses include postponement of cohort evaluation (to after first winter of life), harvest restrictions following mortality events and habitat enhancement. Future research should place more emphasis on the ecological aspects of winter mortality including the influences of food-web structure on starvation and predation. Beyond illuminating an understudied life-history phase, studies of overwintering ecology are integral to contemporary issues in fisheries ecology including ecosystem management, habitat evaluation, and impacts of climate change. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.},

An informative parallel approach is to develop size-based methods. These capture the properties of food webs that describe energy flux and production at a particular size, independent of species' ecology. We couple a physical–biogeochemical model with a dynamic, size-based food web model to predict the future effects of climate change on fish biomass and production in 11 large regional shelf seas, with and without fishing effects. Changes in potential fish production are shown to most strongly mirror changes in phytoplankton production. We project declines of 30–60{\%} in potential fish production across some important areas of tropical shelf and upwelling seas, most notably in the eastern Indo-Pacific, the northern Humboldt and the North Canary Current. Conversely, in some areas of the high latitude shelf seas, the production of pelagic predators was projected to increase by 28–89{\%}.},

abstract = {Cape hakes, Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis, are important gadoid fish that are commercially harvested in the Benguela Current system off Namibia and South Africa. The aim of this study was to elucidate the nutritional condition and feeding preferences of their larvae. Hake eggs and larvae were sampled in austral spring of two consecutive years, 2007 and 2008, off the west coast of South Africa. They were identified to species using genetics, and total lipid content and fatty acid (FA) composition were analysed for each individual egg and larva to compare the condition of different early life stages of both hake species. Higher abundances of M. paradoxus eggs and larvae were consistently found compared to M. capensis. In both species, eggs contained wax esters (WE) and had significantly higher lipid content per dry mass than larvae. Lipid content as well as FA composition changed with the developmental stage of larvae. Quantities of essential fatty acid (EFA) increased with feeding of larvae due to dietary lipid incorporation. In 2007, yolk-sac larvae contained significantly lower total lipids than in 2008. It is argued that this was due to reduced lipid transfer by the spawning females to the eggs. These findings indicate that maternal effects are important in determining condition of hake larvae and that this may have an effect on their survival and subsequent recruitment.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted during the summer of 2008 and 2009 to study the growth of early post yolk-sac European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus, Linnaeus, 1758) larvae reared under different food regimes. The fatty acid composition was used to assess nutritional condition of the larvae. Prey items used in the experiments were Gymnodinium sanguineum, Brachionus plicatilis and nauplii of the copepods Acartia grani and Euterpina acutifrons. Food type and concentration affected the growth of the larvae. Mixed diets composed of rotifers and copepod nauplii at high concentration resulted in higher anchovy larvae growth rates in comparison with single-prey diets using either rotifers or copepod nauplii. The addition of the dinoflagellate G. sanguineum (25-50cellsml -1) to the prey offered did not enhance significantly larval growth. Highest growth rates of anchovy larvae (0.28mmd -1) were obtained using high concentrations of a mixed diet, particularly the combination of rotifers and A. grani nauplii. Fatty acid composition at hatch was similar to the composition observed in the field, but during larvae ontogeny there was a marked decrease in the contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). Such difference reflects the high requirements of these PUFA for larvae development, and suggests that the food offered failed to fulfill the larvae nutritional requirements. The growth rates obtained in our experiments were, overall, in the lower range of those observed in natural conditions. Taking into considerations the fact that larvae in the field are expected to encounter lower prey concentrations, we discuss the reasons for such disagreement. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Relations of rate and efficiency of growth to ingestion were similar in terms of carbon and nitrogen. Growth was linearly related to ingestion (r2 = 0.89, n = 9). Starved larvae lost mass at a specific rate of 0.03 d-I (3 {\%} dl) until death at 14 d. A specific ingestion rate of 0.04 d1 was required to balance defecation and metabolism. Gross growth efficiency (growth ratehngestion rate) rose from - 1.2 at a low ingestion rate (0.015 dl) to 0.4 at the greatest observed ingestion rate (0.11 d'). Condition factor (dry weight length3) was significantly related to both ingestion rate and length (r2 = 0.69, n = 20). These results, combined with those for other fish larvae, indicate an asymptotic relation between rates of growth and ingestion such that gross growth efficiency is maximal (0.4) at intermediate ingestion rate. Fish larvae surviving in the sea appear to maximize their ingestion rate and thus grow rapidly but with a reduced efficiency.},

abstract = {A combined mesocosm and microcosm approach was employed to analyze the impact of age, and of size independent of age effects, of yolk-sac capelin larvae Mallotus villosus on their vulnerability to predation. The impact by both visual (3-spined stickleback Casterosteus aculeatus) and non-visual (jellyfish Staurophora mertensi) predators was evaluated. We found, as predicted from the hterature, that the probability of capture by both predator types decreased with larval age. However, contrary to the current view, when the predators were offered a mixture, and hence a cholce, of larvae separated in age by 2 d, the probability of death by predation was higher for older larvae. We also examined size effects, independent of age effects, by generating large and small larvae of ident{\~{}}cala ge through artificial fertilization of eggs from selected capelin females. We found no difference in the probability of capture of small versus large larvae of the same age. Yet, when the predators were presented with a mixture, and hence a choice of small versus large larvae, the larger larvae experienced higher mortality. This, too, is counter to current thinking. We show that being smaller at a given age may actually confer a survival advantage to larvae. These outcomes are discussed in terms of the interacting probabilities of encounter, attack and capture which define the probability of larval death due to predation.},

abstract = {Extensive plankton collections were taken during seven September cruises (1990-93) along the inner continental shelf of the northcentral Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Despite the high productivity and availability of food during these cruises, significant smallscale spatial variability was found in larval growth rates for both Atlantic bumper (Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Carangidae) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens, Lutjanidae). The observed variability in larval growth rates was not correlated with changes in water temperature or associated with conspicuous hydrographic features and suggested the existence of less-recognizable regions where conditions for growth vary. Cruise estimates of mortality coefficients (Z) for larval Atlantic bumper (n=32,241 larvae from six cruises) and vermilion snapper (n= 2581 larvae from four cruises) ranged from 0.20 to 0.37 and 0.19 to 0.29, respectively. Even in a subtropical climate like the GOM, where larval-stage durations may be as short as two weeks, observed variability in growth rates, particularly when combined with small changes in mortality rates, can cause order-of-magnitude differences in cumulative larval survival. To what extent the observed differences in growth rates at small spatial scales are fine-scale "noise" that ultimately is smoothed by larger-scale processes is not known. Future research is needed to further characterize the small-scale variability in growth rates of larvae, particularly with regard to microzooplankton patchiness and the temporal and spatial pattern of potential predators. Small-scale spatial variability in larval growth rates may in fact be the norm, and understanding the implications of this subtle mosaic may help us to better evaluate our ability to partition the causes of recruitment variability.},

Fulton's K (weight/length3) was not correlated with prey density in which larvae were reared, indicating that this index of condition is inappropriate for larvae immediately after yolk sac absorption. Fulton's K was also not positively correlated with the ability to avoid a simulated predator. However, predation avoidance was positively correlated with higher prey density. A second measure of condition, body height standar- dized for length, appeared to be a more sensitive indicator of condition but also did not correlate with the ability of larvae to avoid predation. The results of a buoyancy experiment indicated that poorly fed larvae may occur higher in the water column, and thus may be more vulnerable to predation or cause a sampling bias in ichthyoplankton studies.},

abstract = {The Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus started to decline after 1989. Recruitment to age 1 population was small in four year-classes from 1988 to 1991. The population decline after 1989 resulted from recruitment failures in 4 consecutive years. Egg production was high in the years of poor recruitment. The recruitment failures were caused not by a reduction in reproductive output but by low survival between egg stage and age 1 recruitment. Abundance of post first-feeding larvae positively correlated with egg and yolksac larval abundance. Mortality at the first-feeding stage was not so variable as to destroy correlations between the abundance of early life stages. The population of age 1 recruits did not correlate with the abundance of post first-feeding larvae. Recruitment of the sardine was not fixed by the end of the first-feeding stage. Cumulative mortality through the early life stages, rather than relatively instantaneous mortality at the first-feeding stage, is thought to be responsible for the recruitment success or failure and eventual population fluctuations of the sardine.},

abstract = {Anchovy and sardine are both abundant small pelagic fish that have exhibited out-of-phase population oscillations in both the western boundary current region off Japan and the eastern boundary current upwelling region off California. These species alternations could indicate approximately synchronous patterns (with some variations in timing between ecosystems) despite the reversed temperature regimes for certain periods across the North Pacific, at least until recently. Here we suggest a contrasting pattern of temperature optima for anchovy and sardine spawnings between the opposite sides of the North Pacific as a possible mechanism of the synchronous phases of species alternations. Spawning temperature optima were examined for Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) and Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus), based on occurrence of eggs and larvae in relation to sea surface temperature. The analyses were based on an updated long-term data set of egg and larval surveys from 1978 to 2004 (102,660 net tows) in the western North Pacific. The ratio of relative frequencies of plankton net samples that are positive for eggs or larvae versus all samples was calculated for temperature intervals of 0.1 degrees C for both species. This spawning temperature index exceeded 1.0 (baseline for optimum) from ca. 15 to 28 degrees C with a mid-point at 22 degrees C for anchovy and ca. 13-20 degrees C with a marked peak at 16-17 degrees C for sardine. Patterns of spawning temperature clearly show "warm" and "eurythermal" Japanese anchovy and "cool" and "stenothermal" Japanese sardine in the western North Pacific. This relationship between anchovy and sardine showed a marked contrast to earlier published reports on the spawning temperature optima of northern anchovy (E. mordax) and California sardine (S. sagax) in the California Current system. The spawning temperature optimum appears to be species-specific rather than genus-specific, The reversed species-specific temperature optima of anchovy and sardine under the reversed temperature regimes could provide a possible theoretical solution to the synchronous anchovy and sardine regime shifts across the North Pacific.

We show that the somatic growth rates sharply increased after metamorphosis to the early juvenile stage, whereas previously, others showed that growth rate decreases during the larval stage. Otolith growth rates were more variable during the juvenile stage than the larval stage. Interannual variations in the otolith growth rate after metamorphosis explained more than 80{\%} of variation in abundances of recruits (ca. 8-10 months old) in the Pacific coastal waters, whereas no correlation was found between the growth rate during the early larval stage and abundance.

Back-calculated knob length at the di erent temperatures indicated no signi{\textregistered}cant di erence to the measured knob lengths except for the cases at 20 °C from hatching to 9-d-old larvae and at 14 °C from 20- to 30-d-old larvae.

abstract = {The growth-mortality relationship was assessed for larval cohorts of the Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus using two new approaches: (1) repeat measures in general linear model (RM-GLMs) and (2) the autoregressive-individual method (AIM). Both methods were compared to the traditional approach in which repeat-measure ANOVA was used to compare the changes in increment width (W(I)) at age and otolith radii (R(O)) at age between individuals from an original population and survivors. In RM-GLMs, both the W(I) at age and R(O) at age (i.e. at 5, 10, 15 and 20 days) were used as the dependent variables, and the standardized residuals of both regressions R(O) and age and R(O) and total length (L(T)), age class, and day of the year as independent variables. A significant increase in W(I) at age and R(O) at age from younger to older age classes was seen as indicative of growth-dependent selection. In AIM, the R(O)-at-age relationship for each fish was fitted for the first 20 days, using autoregression, and then the growth traits (i.e. slopes) between the original cohorts and survivors were compared using ANOVA. In the traditional approach, the W(I) at age and R(O) at age for the first 20 days of an original population were compared with those of survivors sampled in later stages. GLMs and traditional approaches supported the growth rate (i.e. the faster an individual grows, the higher its probability of survival) and bigger is better (i.e. larger individuals at any given age will have lower probability of mortality than smaller individuals of the same age) mechanisms. Furthermore, AIM showed that individuals from original cohorts had lower otolith growth rates than those from survivors, giving further support for the growth-mortality hypothesis for the larval stage of this clupeid.},

abstract = {The theory of recruitment in fishes and hypotheses pertaining to causes of recruitment fluctuation are summarized. In spite of considerable research effort over several decades there has been no significant improvement in identifying clear causal mechanisms of recruitment in marine fish stocks. Starvation has not been demonstrated to be a primary mechanism controlling survival of fish larvae. Studies matching food levels and year-class strength continue to provide indirect evidence that growth during the first year of life is dependent on food supply and may be important in determining survival. The hypothesis that survival is a direct function of growth provides a rational theoretical framework for recruitment research and is suggested as a basis for future work. Growth rate must be studied as a function of both ration and temperature. Studies examining the relationship of growth rate to survival should be specific to each life history stage and ideally integrated throughout the pre-recruit period. It remains to be demonstrated that survival is a direct function of growth, mediated through size-dependent predation.},

abstract = {Based on the relationship between otolith and somatic growth rates, we examined the effect of growth and developmental rates on survival during larval and early juvenile stages in Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus collected in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region in the western North Pacific. Mean daily otolith increment width (IW) positively correlated with mean growth and developmental rates in rearing experiments. In the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region, faster-growing larvae with larger IWs attained completion of metamorphosis at younger ages than slower-growing larvae. The minimum IWs in the recruited adults collected in 1999 greatly increased from 4.8 mum at 40 d after hatching to 11.0 mum at 60 d, while the minimum IWs in the pre-recruits collected in 1998 was less than 5.0 mum at 60 d, and accounted for ca. 60{\%} of the total pre-recruit population. Based on the positive relationship between IWs and growth rates in the rearing experiments, an IW of 11.0 pm is estimated to correspond to 0.41 mm d(-1) in growth rate. It was concluded that pre-recruits with growth rates {\textless}0.41 mm d(-1) at 60 d have a negligible probability of survival to recruitment. Mortality dependent on growth and developmental rates occurred in the metamorphosing stage of E. japonicus in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region. Since environmental conditions in the transition region are variable, and these conditions affect growth and developmental rates of larvae, the rates in the metamorphosing stage could determine the abundance of recruited 1 yr old E. japonicus in the transition region.},

annote = {A two-dimensional individual-based fish movement model coupled with fish bioenergetics was developed to simulate the observed migration and growth of Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) in the western North Pacific. In the model, derived from the observed oceanenvironmental data as the driving force, fish movement was adapted as a kinesis behavior. The model successfully simulated the observed transport patterns during the egg and larval stages and the northward migrations during the juvenile stage in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The model results showed that both temperature during the larval stage in the Kuroshio Extension and the prey availability during the early juvenile stage in the KuroshioOyashio transitional area are important factors for growth of Japanese sardine. In autumn, the observed juvenile sardine were mainly distributed in the subarctic water region off the Kuril Islands, which is an area (158165 degrees E, 4347 degrees N) with a high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration. The model reproduced the fish distribution, which has a high density in this region. The high Chl-a concentration area in autumn may contribute to increasing the survival rate of Japanese sardine by cascading up the food chain, from the high primary production, and is an important habitat for recruitment success of Japanese sardine.},

abstract = {Predator-specific growth-selective predation on larval Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus was demonstrated by comparing growth rates between the larvae ingested by predators and the larvae from the corresponding original populations through otolith microstructure analysis, based on original data and reanalyzed data from previous studies. Ingested larvae from the stomachs of small pelagic predators (juvenile Japanese anchovy, round herring Etrumeus teres, jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus and white croaker Pennahia argentatus) had significantly lower growth rates than the larvae from the original populations in general. For large piscivorous predators (sea bass Lateolabrax japonicus, greater amberjack Seriola dumerili and skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis), no measurable differences in the growth rates were observed between ingested larvae and larvae from the original populations. Small pelagic fish were therefore identified as growth-selective predators, whereas large piscivorous fish were identified as non-growth-selective predators. Exponential declines in the relative predation mortalities of larvae with higher growth rates suggest the potential for growth rate to exert a great effect on recruitment variability. However, the predator field would regulate selection for growth characteristics of survivors.},

abstract = {Spatial and temporal spawning overlaps in Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus and sardine Sardinops melanostictus were examined using a long-term data set (1978 to 2004) of monthly egg and larval surveys (total of 102613 vertical tow samples) off the Pacific coast of Japan. Egg abundance was estimated in 15' latitude x 15' longitude squares, and spawning area was calculated by summing areas of squares positive for egg occurrence. Both species had offshore expansion (inshore contraction) of spawning grounds with protracted (shortened) spawning periods during high- (low-) biomass phases. Although anchovy and sardine had different peak spawning periods (April to July and February to March, respectively), their spawnings were coincident from February to June in coastal waters. For anchovy, annual overlapping spawning area percentages of total spawning area and egg abundances in overlapping areas as percentages of total egg abundances were consistently low (6.4 to 30.6 {\%} and 7.2 to 39.9 {\%}, respectively). In contrast, for sardine these percentages were consistently high and notably increased as population size decreased (21.1 to 80.8{\%} and 1.4 to 86.9{\%}, respectively). Averaged over 5 yr (2000 to 2004), 68.5 {\%} of the total area of sardine spawning grounds overlapped with anchovy spawning grounds, and 61.8 {\%} of annual sardine egg abundance was produced in spawning grounds that overlapped with anchovy. Thus, Japanese sardine population recovery is likely more difficult than Japanese anchovy population recovery (when interspecific interavtions occur).},

The otolith daily increment widths were wider in the early juveniles with faster larval growth rate than in those with slower growth rate. Otolith daily increment widths tended to be wider in the adult survivors than in the original cohort after age 40 d.

abstract = {Growth and condition of larval Engraulis encrasicolus larvae in the Bay of Biscay were analysed relative to their biochemical composition. Protein, carbohydrate, lipid, DNA and RNA contents of larvae were quantified during larval ontogeny to analyse changes associated with growth. Proteins were the main organic component of E. encrasicolus at every larval stage, followed by lipids and carbohydrates. The increase in relative protein content in terms of protein percentage (P{\%}) and the decrease in lipid relative content (L{\%}) of the total organic matter (OM) with size observed are consistent with the definition of Type I larvae. Protein relative content increased until the P{\%} in larvae reached similar to 71 {\%}, whereas L{\%} and carbohydrate relative content (CH{\%}) declined, exhibiting minimum values of similar to 20, and similar to 6 {\%}, respectively. In general terms, the feeding condition of larvae, as defined by their RNA/DNA ratio, was good. Food did not seem to be a major factor limiting larval growth in the study area throughout late spring and early summer. The RNA/DNA ratio was size-related and increased during larval growth up to an asymptotic optimal value of similar to 3.6 in postflexion larvae in relative protein content, in terms of protein percentage (P{\%}). The 'actual' RNA/DNA ratios found in a given larval population when compared with the 'starving' RNA/DNA ratio, and using an 'absolutely optimal' value as complementary information, could be used to determine the overall status of the population. Parental effect of low egg quality is a possible explanation of delayed ontogenetical development of larvae from July 2000.},

abstract = {Effect of wind stress on the annual catch of Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus off northwestern Kyushu for the period between 1963 and 2009 was inves- tigated. Regime shift analysis detected several step changes in catch and environmental variables. Since the mid-1980s, the anchovy catch in the coastal fishery zones has declined, while the catch in the offshore zone has increased. The decline of catch in the coastal zones showed a significant correlation with the long-term variations in prevailing north-northeastward wind stress over the Goto-Nada Sea during spring spawning season. The results indicated that weakened north-northeastward winds caused the recent low recruitment of anchovy through low levels of wind-induced eggs and larval transport from the offshore spawning ground to the coastal nursery areas, resulting in the potential shift of nursery area to the northwestern offshore region. Thus, as well as the growth-favorable ambient temperature, transport process would play a key role on long-term fluctuations in anchovy abundance in these coastal seas.},

abstract = {In this study, clarification and consideration of the recruitment process in relation to the stock fluctuation of the Japanese sardine, which is one of the important pelagic fish in Japan was made. Recruitment mechanism for the sardine, namely the mechanism of the stock fluctuation has not been sufficiently explained, because there were few basic biological characteristics for many ecological results obtained up to present. More important thing in the sardine study at present is to estimate the past biological or ecological results again in order to find out new biological characteristics from them and to analyze the recruitment mechanism by a systematic integration of the basic characters. Some factors regarding the fluctuation in the recruitment process from the egg period to adding as a one-year-old fish from the viewpoints of the interrelations between physical and biological environment and the life history of the Japanese sardine were studied. Most of the data are from the spawning survey which have been carried out by the Marine Resources Division of the Tokai Regional Fisheries Laboratory and the ichthyoplankton survey within a 200 mile area from Japan under the guidance of the Fisheries Agency. Consideration was given to the recruitment mechanism related to the stock fluctuation on the basis of two important points, so as to clarify the status in taxonomy, morphology, early development, life cycle, developmental stages, migration, spawning characters, early mortality and the recruitment process of the Japanese sardine, and moreover, to analyze some environmental or ecological factors related to mortality during the recruitment process.},

@article{Kawaguchi2009,
abstract = {Pacific herring Clupea pallasii and Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus, which belong to the same order Clupeiformes, spawn different types of eggs: demersal adherent eggs and pelagic eggs, respectively. We cloned three cDNAs for Pacific herring hatching enzyme and five for Japanese anchovy. Each of them was divided into two groups (group A and B) by phylogenetic analysis. They were expressed specifically in hatching gland cells (HGCs), which differentiated from the pillow and migrated to the edge of the head in both species. HGCs of Japanese anchovy stopped migration at that place, whereas those of Pacific herring continued to migrate dorsally and distributed widely all over the head region. During evolution, the program for the HGC migration would be varied to adapt to different hatching timing. Analysis of the gene expression revealed that Pacific herring embryos synthesized a large amount of hatching enzyme when compared with Japanese anchovy. Chorion of Pacific herring embryo was about 7.5 times thicker than that of Japanese anchovy embryo. Thus, the difference in their gene expression levels between two species is correlated with the difference in the thickness of chorion. These results suggest that the hatching system of each fish adapted to its respective hatching environment. Finally, hatching enzyme genes were cloned from each genomic DNA. The exon-intron structure of group B genes basically conserved that of the ancestral gene, whereas group A genes lost one intron. Several gene-specific changes of the exon-intron structure owing to nucleotide insertion and/or duplication were found in Japanese anchovy genes.},

@article{Conover2006a,
abstract = {Knowledge of geographic and temporal scales of adaptive genetic variation is crucial to species conservation, yet understanding of these phenomena, particularly in marine systems, is scant. Until recently, the belief has been that because most marine species have highly dispersive or mobile life stages, local adaptation could occur only on broad geographic scales. This view is supported by comparatively low levels of genetic variation among populations as detected by neutral markers. Similarly, the time scale of adaptive divergence has also been assumed to be very long, requiring thousands of generations. Recent studies of a variety of species have challenged these beliefs. First, there is strong evidence of geographically structured local adaptation in physiological and morphological traits. Second, the proportion of quantitative trait variation at the among-population level (QST) is much higher than it is for neutral markers (FST) and these two metrics of genetic variation are poorly correlated. Third, evidence that selection is a potent evolutionary force capable of sustaining adaptive divergence on contemporary time scales is summarized. The differing spatial and temporal scales of adaptive v. neutral genetic divergence call for a new paradigm in thinking about the relationship between phenogeography (the geography of phenotypic variation) and phylogeography (the geography of lineages) in marine species. The idea that contemporary selective processes can cause fine-scale spatial and temporal divergence underscores the need for a new emphasis on Darwinian fishery science.},

@article{Takasuka2007a,
abstract = {The out-of-phase population oscillations between anchovy and sardine have been attributed to climate changes. However, the biological processes causing these species alternations have remained unresolved. Here we propose a simple "optimal growth temperature" hypothesis, in which anchovy and sardine regime shifts are caused by differential optimal temperatures for growth rates during the early life stages. Dome-shaped relationships between growth rate and sea temperature were detected for both Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) and Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) larvae based on otolith microstructure analysis. The optimal growth rate for anchovy larvae occurred at 22.0 degrees C, whereas that for sardine larvae occurred at 16.2 degrees C. Ambient temperatures have historically fluctuated between these optima, which could lead to contrasting fluctuations in larval growth rates between the two species. This simple mechanism could potentially cause the shifts between the warm anchovy regime and the cool sardine regime in the western North Pacific. Although retrospective analysis suggested synergistic effects of other factors (e.g., trophic interactions and fishing), the optimal growth temperature concept would provide a possible biological mechanism of anchovy and sardine regime shifts.},

The initial length of anchovy larvae at time t = 0 was l(0) = 2.71 mm. The obtained value of the predicted length at metamorphosis was a = 36.87 mm. A growth rate of 0.94 mm d(-1) was calculated for 8 mm larvae at a mean temperature of 23.0 degrees C, whilst the greatest rate was 1.06 mm d(-1) for 14.3 mm larvae (14-day-old).

abstract = {The relationship between batch fecundity and egg size in Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus in Tosa Bay and off the Kii Channel, southwestern Japan from 1990 to 1993, was examined using females whose yolk volume of oocytes became constant after hydration at the final maturational stage. Positive correlations were recognized between these two among females whose batch fecundities were less than 30,000 eggs, while negative correlations were recognized among females those of which were more than 30,000 eggs, even if they were of the same body length or age. From 1990 to 1992, the former females distributed in the coastal area of Tosa Bay with relatively low surface temperature, while the latter females distributed in the offshore area of Tosa Bay or the frontal region of the Kuroshio Current off the Kii Channel with relatively high surface temperature. In 1993, these offshore spawners in the Kuroshio region became almost extinct, simultaneously many females that spawned more than 30,000 eggs per single spawning were observed in Tosa Bay. These results suggest that the spatial changes of batch fecundity of sardines from 1990 to 1992, which influenced the egg size, resulted in the population-specific fecundity},

abstract = {Eleven ichthyoplankton surveys, conducted during  the winter and spring quarters of 1978 and 1979, indi-  cate that spawning of the northern anchovy, Engruulis  mordux, was contracted both spatially and temporally  in 1978 relative to 1979. Larvae were farther offshore  in 1979. Instantaneous daily larval mortality rate esti-  mated from slope of the age-frequency distribution  (yolk sac through 15 mm, ca. 25-30 days) varied in-  significantly between 1978 and 1979 and averaged  0.168. Comparison to a simple model of spawning  suggests that seasonal changes in the slopes are due  solely to a systematic bias and not to real changes in  the mortality rate.   Seasonal larval production was compared with  birthdate distributions of fish surviving to the juvenile  stage. In both years March had the greatest larval pro-  duction and was the commonest month of birth among  the survivors of the larval stage. Larval survivorship  tended to increase within the 1978 spawning season  and decrease within the 1979 season. Low survivor-  ship in winter 1978 is consistent with the hypothesis  that winter storms disrupted aggregations of prey  necessary for larval feeding, but does not explain why  apparent recruitment was greater in 1978 than 1979.  Variation in larval survivorship could not be attributed  to larval mortality. The offshore distribution of larvae  in 1979 may have contributed to the relatively low  survival. },

The larvae reached PNR on 7.7, 5.2 and 4.2 days-post-hatching (dph) at 15, 18 and 21o C, respectively. At each temperature, larval growth did not differ significantly among the delayed initial feedings 1 day before PNR but decreased significantly in larvae first fed after that. In the treatments where initial feeding was equally delayed, larvae grew significantly faster at 18 and 21o C than at 15o C. The larvae survived apparently better at 15 and 18o C than at 21o C when initial feeding was equally delayed. At each temperature, survival of the larvae first fed before PNR did not differ noticeably, while delayed initial feeding after that apparently reduced their survival. These results indicated that there existed a negatively temperature-dependent PNR in the Japanese flounder larvae. Survival and growth of the larvae strongly depended on temperature as well as the timing of initial feeding. High temperature accelerated the yolk exhaustion and growth of the larvae and thus reduced their starvation tolerance and survival. To avoid potential starvation mortality and obtain good growth, the Japanese flounder larvae must establish successful initial feeding within 2 days after yolk exhaustion at 15o C and within 1 day at both 18 and 21o C.},

The adult parameters: sex ratio, batch fecundity and weight of mature females, were estimated from the adult samples obtained during the survey and the spawning frequency was calculated as the mean from the historical series. The spawning biomass estimate resulted in 42,979 t with a coefficient of variation of 15{\%}, which supposes an increase of about 73{\%} over the SSB estimate of 2009 produced in a similar way by the DEPM.},

There is evidence of latitudinal differences in the duration of the spawning period associated with regional temperature variations. The main spawning areas of the anchovy are located in the Gulf of Lyons and at the shelf surrounding the Ebro river delta. The exten- sions of spawning grounds seem to be linked to the size of the shelf and to the degree of hydrographic enriching-process- es. Punctual studies on egg and larval ecology have been made mainly in the areas of the main spawning grounds, report- ing preliminary results on growth, feeding, condition and mortality estimates.

abstract = {A prominent response of temperate aquatic ecosystems to climate warming is changes in phenology - advancements or delays in annually reoccurring events in an organism's life cycle. The exact seasonal timing of warming, in conjunction with species-specific life-history events such as emergence from resting stages, timing of spawning, generation times, or stage-specific prey requirements, may determine the nature of a species' response. We demonstrate that recent climate-induced shifts in the phenology of lake phytoplankton and zooplankton species in a temperate eutrophic lake (Muggelsee, Germany) differed according to differences in their characteristic life cycles. Fast-growing plankton in spring (diatoms, Daphnia) showed significant and synchronous forward movements by about 1 month, induced by concurrent earlier ice break-up dates (diatoms) and higher spring water temperature (Daphnia). No such synchrony was observed for slow-growing summer zooplankton species with longer and more complex life cycles (copepods, larvae of the mussel Dreissena polymorpha). Although coexisting, the summer plankton responded species specifically to seasonal warming trends, depending on whether the timing of warming matched their individual thermal requirements at decisive developmental stages such as emergence from diapause (copepods), or spawning (Dreissena). Others did not change their phenology significantly, but nevertheless, increased in abundances. We show that the detailed seasonal pattern of warming influences the response of phyto- and zooplankton species to climate change, and point to the diverse nature of responses for species exhibiting complex life-history traits.},

abstract = {Abstract: Lipid content and composition of some dominant copepods inhabiting the Oyashio waters were analyzed by the thin layer chromatography flame ionization detection (TLC/FID) method. Copepod samples were collected during the RV Shoyo-maru cruise from September 18 to October 15 in 1988. A new three-step development: the first in hexane and diethyl ether (66 : 4, v/v), the second in hexane, diethyl ether and formic-acid (55 : 15 : 0.5) and the last in hexane and benzene (1 : 1), single scan method by TLC/FID was found to be useful for separation and analysis of lipids in boreal copepods. As a result, the eight species of calanoid copepods analyzed in this study could be divided into two groups according to their lipid class proportions. One group consisted of copepods containing many wax esters and includes Neocalanus flemingeri, N. cristatus, Pseudocalanus minutus, Metridia pacifica and M. okhotensis. The other group containing many triglycerides includes Eucalanus bungii, Pleuromamma abdominalis and Acartia omorii. I have deduced that copepods storing wax esters could have long periods of dormancy in winter and consume lipids mainly for reproduction, while copepods storing triglycerides could overwinter without a period of dormancy and be opportunistic feeders.},

abstract = {Upon settlement, many fishes undergo an energetically costly metamorphic period that requires substantial nutritional reserves. Larval growth and the accumulation of lipids prior to metamorphosis are likely to influence growth and survival following this critical period. On the Caribbean island of St. Croix, I investigated relationships between larval growth, early life-history characteristics, and post-metamorphic lipid content in the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum. Lipid reserves remaining after metamorphosis were positively related (r2 = 0.62) to the width of the metamorphic band; thus, this otolith-derived trait may be used to estimate the condition at emergence of survivors collected at some later time. In contrast, pelagic larval duration, average larval growth, and otolith size at settlement were negatively related to post-metamorphic lipid content. Interestingly, the trend for slower growth among fish in good condition was not consistent over the entire pelagic larval duration. Analyses of daily larval growth histories indicated that fish with high lipid reserves grew rapidly in the last week prior to settlement, but relatively slowly during the early phases of larval life; those emerging with low lipid concentrations, however, displayed strikingly opposite patterns. These contrasting patterns of growth and energy storage were consistent at two sites and over three recruitment events. Otolith chemistry data suggested that differences in growth histories and body condition were consistent with the hypothesis of larval development in distinct oceanic environments (characterized by Pb concentration); but, within a water mass, differences reflected life-history trade-offs between growth and energy storage. The results have implications for understanding the processes driving juvenile survival, which may be condition dependent.},

abstract = {Since the days of Elton, population cycles have challenged ecologists and resource managers. Although the underlying mechanisms remain debated, theory holds that both density-dependent and density-independent processes shape the dynamics. One striking example is the large-scale fluctuations of sardine and anchovy observed across the major upwelling areas of the world. Despite a long history of research, the causes of these fluctuations remain unresolved and heavily debated, with significant implications for fisheries management. We here model the underlying causes of these fluctuations, using the California Current Ecosystem as a case study, and show that the dynamics, accurately reproduced since A.D. 1661 onward, are explained by interacting density-dependent processes (i.e., through species-specific life-history traits) and climate forcing. Furthermore, we demonstrate how fishing modifies the dynamics and show that the sardine collapse of the 1950s was largely unavoidable given poor recruitment conditions. Our approach provides unique insight into the origin of sardine-anchovy fluctuations and a knowledge base for sustainable fisheries management in the California Current Ecosystem and beyond.},

Estimated mean abundances of larval cohorts at 20 d varied by a factor of 45, reflecting differences in initial abundances of eggs and the variable mortality rates. Models of bay anchovy growth and mortality in relation to prey concentration, developed in previous laboratory experiments, were used to partition field-experiment mortalities into nutrition-related and presumed predation-related components.

abstract = {1. Although it is not clear to what extent density dependence acts on the survival, emigration or growth of organisms, experiments testing alternative explanations are rare. A field experiment on 1-year-old brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) was undertaken to address the following questions: are the mortality, movement and growth of wild stream-living trout affected by population density? If so, are the density-dependent effects of released hatchery trout different from the effects of wild fish? 2. In each of two small streams, two replicate treatment blocks were used, each with four treatments assigned to stream sections 50-70 m in length: (1) control, no fish was introduced and population density was kept at its original level. (2) Trout biomass was doubled by introducing additional wild fish. (3) Trout biomass was doubled by introducing additional hatchery fish. (4) Hatchery trout were introduced, but biomass was kept at its original level by the removal of some resident wild fish. 3. We found no treatment effects on the recapture rates of resident trout, which suggests that survival was not strongly affected by competition. They were also remarkably stationary, regardless of treatment. However, trout growth rate was reduced to the same extent in both treatments with increased density, suggesting that growth was negatively density-dependent, and that the density-dependent effects of hatchery trout and introduced wild fish were similar. 4. Wild resident fish grew faster than introduced wild trout, which in turn grew faster than hatchery trout. Hatchery fish and introduced wild fish moved more than wild resident fish. 5. The results show that population density affected growth in trout parr. We conclude that competition is not limited to the underyearlings, as has previously been suggested, and that density-dependent growth is the main density-dependent response in yearling trout. Furthermore, this effect was the same for wild and hatchery-reared competitors, suggesting that stocking of hatchery fish may affect natural populations negatively through density dependence.},

abstract = {The Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus started to decline after 1989. Recruitment to age 1 population was small in four year-classes from 1988 to 1991. The population decline after 1989 resulted from recruitment failures in 4 consecutive years. Egg production was high in the years of poor recruitment. The recruitment failures were caused not by a reduction in reproductive output but by low survival between egg stage and age 1 recruitment. Abundance of post first-feeding larvae positively correlated with egg and yolksac larval abundance. Mortality at the first-feeding stage was not so variable as to destroy correlations between the abundance of early life stages. The population of age 1 recruits did not correlate with the abundance of post first-feeding larvae. Recruitment of the sardine was not fixed by the end of the first-feeding stage. Cumulative mortality through the early life stages, rather than relatively instantaneous mortality at the first-feeding stage, is thought to be responsible for the recruitment success or failure and eventual population fluctuations of the sardine.},

abstract = {The rate of water renewal in fish tanks is biologically important in land-based aquaculture systems as it affects many of the water quality limiting factors for fish production. Current water velocity, a factor closely related to water flow rate, can significantly affect fish performance in culture tanks. A study was carried out to test the effect of three relative water velocities of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 body lengths per second (bl/s) on the growth of California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) juveniles over 10??weeks of culture. Nine rectangular tanks were used in this experiment to provide the velocities to be tested, which were stocked with 15 fish each. Weaned California halibut 90??days post hatch (dph), 5.4??cm average total length, and 1.53??g average wet weight were used for this study. All fish were sampled every other week to record their biomass and morphometric data. This research has shown that California halibut juveniles can be raised between 0.5 and 1.5??bl/s without affecting their survival.

abstract = {The nature of the western portions of the biogeographic temperate or transition zones in the North Pacific and North Atlantic is reviewed. The physical transport of nutrients and biomass into them from the Kuroshio and Gulf Stream as well as from the poleward sides are estimated. The conclusion is that the upwelling in the two western boundary currents makes the largest contribution to the nutrient and biomass fluxes into these transition zones. A conservative estimate of the amount of upwelled fluid is derived from absolute velocity sections in the Gulf Stream. The estimate suggests that upwelling into the euphoric zone exceeds 2 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1). This implies that upwelling in these western boundary currents matches or exceeds that in eastern boundary cur-rents such as the California Current. The two western boundary regimes have very different poleward situations. The Oyashio extension flows parallel to the Kuroshio and is a deep current. The North Atlantic Shelf Front flow is to the west where it is ultimately entrained into the edge of the Gulf Stream. There does not seem to be any tendency for this to occur in the Kuroshio. Despite these differences in the northern and western boundaries, the two transition zones are similar with large amplitude meanders, anticyclonic rings and streamers dominating their physical structure. The physical features responsible for the transfer of materials from the boundary current extensions into the transition zones are similar in both systems. Ring formation contributes only similar to 10{\%} of the transfer, while ring-induced streamers contribute 30{\%}. The rest of the transport is contributed by branching of the boundary current front. Both currents have well developed secondary fronts consisting of subtropical surface water pulled into the transition zone. Biologically, the upwelling in both western boundary currents leads to a biomass maximum along the boundary in both secondary producers (copepods) and in small pelagic fish. In the Kuroshio, the latter are the Japanese sardine, Sardinops melanostictus, that spawn in the Kuroshio and then enter the transition zone for the summer and fall months. In the Gulf Stream, the dominate species are menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus and B, smithi. These species make use of the coastal environments of North America and although the adults spawn in the Gulf Stream, they are not thought to play a major role in the Slope Water, transition zone. The similar differences in the use of the Kuroshio and the Gulf Stream ecosystems occurs in the behaviour of bluefin tuna, squid and other large pelagics. The Gulf Stream system also lacks an equivalent to Pacific saury, Cololabis saira. The biology therefore is at least subtly different, with saury and sardines being replaced by mid-water fish in the North Atlantic. A fuller comparison of the biology with quantitative methods in both systems should be encouraged.},

abstract = {A number of recent studies have reported an ENSO-like EOF mode in the global sea surface temperature (SST) field, whose time variability is marked by an abrupt change toward a warmer tropical eastern Pacific and a colder extratropical central North Pacific in 1976–77. The present study compares this pattern with the structure of the interannual variability associated with the ENSO cycle and documents its time history back to 1900. The analysis is primarily based on the leading EOFs of the SST anomaly and ‘‘anomaly deviation'' fields in various domains and the associated expansion coefficient (or principal component) time series, which are used to construct global regression maps of SST, sea level pressure (SLP), and a number of related variables. The use of ‘‘anomaly deviations'' (i.e., departures of local SST anomalies from the concurrent global-mean SST anomaly) reduces the influence of global-mean SST trends upon the structure of the EOFs and their expansion coefficient time series. An important auxiliary time series used in this study is a ‘‘Southern Oscillation index'' based on marine surface observations. By means of several different analysis techniques, the time variability of the leading EOF of the global SST field is separated into two components: one identified with the ‘‘ENSO cycle-related'' variability on the inter- annual timescale, and the other a linearly independent ‘‘residual'' comprising all the interdecadal variability in the record. The two components exhibit rather similar spatial signatures in the global SST, SLP, and wind stress fields. The SST signature in the residual variability is less equatorially confined in the eastern Pacific and it is relatively more prominent over the extratropical North Pacific. The corresponding SLP signature is also stronger over the extratropical North Pacific, and its counterpart in the cold season 500-mb height field more closely resembles the PNA pattern. The amplitude time series of the ENSO-like pattern in the residual variability reflects the above-mentioned shift in 1976–77, as well as a number of other prominent features, including a shift of opposite polarity during the 1940s.},

abstract = {A latitudinal gradient in biodiversity has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs, yet how and why this gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

abstract = {1. Macroclimatic variation along latitudinal gradients provides an excellent natural laboratory to investigate the role of temperature and the potential impacts of climate warming on terrestrial organisms. 2. Here, we review the use of latitudinal gradients for ecological climate change research, in com- parison with altitudinal gradients and experimental warming, and illustrate their use and caveats with a meta-analysis of latitudinal intraspecific variation in important life-history traits of vascular plants. 3. We first provide an overview of latitudinal patterns in temperature and other abiotic and biotic environmental variables in terrestrial ecosystems. We then assess the latitudinal intraspecific variation present in five key life-history traits [plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), foliar nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) stoichiometry, seed mass and root:shoot (R:S) ratio] in natural populations or common garden experiments across a total of 98 plant species. 4. Intraspecific leaf N:P ratio and seed mass significantly decreased with latitude in natural popula- tions. Conversely, the plant height decreased and SLA increased significantly with latitude of popula- tion origin in common garden experiments. However, less than a third of the investigated latitudinal transect studies also formally disentangled the effects of temperature from other environmental driv- ers which potentially hampers the translation from latitudinal effects into a temperature signal. 5. Synthesis. Latitudinal gradients provide a methodological set-up to overcome the drawbacks of other observational and experimental warming methods. Our synthesis indicates that many life- history traits of plants vary with latitude but the translation of latitudinal clines into responses to temperature is a crucial step. Therefore, especially adaptive differentiation of populations and con- founding environmental factors other than temperature need to be considered. More generally, inte- grated approaches of observational studies along temperature gradients, experimental methods and common garden experiments increasingly emerge as the way forward to further our understanding of species and community responses to climate warming.},

abstract = {Why are there more species in the tropics than in temperate regions? In recent years, this long-standing question has been addressed primarily by seeking environmental correlates of diversity. But to understand the ultimate causes of diversity patterns, we must also examine the evolutionary and biogeographic processes that directly change species numbers (i.e., speciation, extinction, and dispersal). With this perspective, we dissect the latitudinal diversity gradient in hylid frogs. We reconstruct a phylogeny for 124 hylid species, estimate divergence times and diversification rates for major clades, reconstruct biogeographic changes, and use ecological niche modeling to identify climatic variables that potentially limit dispersal. We find that hylids originated in tropical South America and spread to temperate regions only recently (leaving limited time for speciation). There is a strong relationship between the species richness of each region and when that region was colonized but not between the latitudinal positions of clades and their rates of diversification. Temperature seasonality seemingly limits dispersal of many tropical clades into temperate regions and shows significant phylogenetic conservatism. Overall, our study illustrates how two general principles (niche conservatism and the time-for-speciation effect) may help explain the latitudinal diversity gradient as well as many other diversity patterns across taxa and regions.},

abstract = {For many ectotherms, the annual cycle is partitioned into ' growing ' (summer) and ' nongrowing ' (winter) seasons, and the lengths of these seasons are inversely related across a latitudinal gradient. This pattern of variation has the potential to affect diverse life-history traits profoundly. A key selective agent is size-dependent winter mortality which, with increasing latitude, places an increasing premium on attainment of large body size before the first winter of life. Winter body size is determined primarily by two factors: (I) birth date, which defines the beginning of the first growing season and (2) somatic growth rate within the first season. Using examples drawn from the Atlantic silverside, Menidiu menidiu (L.), and other fishes, I show how latitudinal variation in the scheduling of the spawning season, countergradient variation in the capacity for growth and reproduction, and mode of sex determination (environmental v. genetic) represent adaptations to seasonality.},

abstract = {Environmental variation connected with seasonality is likely to affect the evolution of life-history strategies in ectotherms, but there is no consensus as to how important life-history traits like body size are influenced by environmental variation along seasonal gradients. We compared adult body size, skeletal growth, mean age, age at first reproduction and longevity among 11 common frog (Rana temporaria) populations sampled along a 1,600-km-long latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia. Mean age, age at first reproduction and longevity increased linearly with decreasing growth season length. Lifetime activity (i.e. the estimated number of active days during life-time) was highest at mid-latitudes and females had on average more active days throughout their lives than males. Variation in body size was due to differences in lifetime activity among populations--individuals (especially females) were largest where they had the longest cumulative activity period--as well as to differences between populations in skeletal growth rate as determined by skeletochronological analyses. Especially, males grew faster at intermediate latitudes. While life-history trait variation was strongly associated with latitude, the direction and shape of these relationships were sex- and trait-specific. These context-dependent relationships may be the result of life-history trade-offs enforced by differences in future reproductive opportunities and time constraints among the populations. Thus, seasonality appears to be an important environmental factor shaping life-history trait variation in common frogs.},

@article{Baumann2011a,
abstract = {How organisms may adapt to rising global temperatures is uncertain, but concepts can emerge from studying adaptive physiological trait variations across existing spatial climate gradients. Many ectotherms, particularly fish, have evolved increasing genetic growth capacities with latitude (i.e. countergradient variation (CnGV) in growth), which are thought to be an adaptation primarily to strong gradients in seasonality. In contrast, evolutionary responses to gradients in mean temperature are often assumed to involve an alternative mode, 'thermal adaptation'. We measured thermal growth reaction norms in Pacific silverside populations (Atherinops affinis) occurring across a weak latitudinal temperature gradient with invariant seasonality along the North American Pacific coast. Instead of thermal adaptation, we found novel evidence for CnGV in growth, suggesting that CnGV is a ubiquitous mode of reaction-norm evolution in ectotherms even in response to weak spatial and, by inference, temporal climate gradients. A novel, large-scale comparison between ecologically equivalent Pacific versus Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) revealed how closely growth CnGV patterns reflect their respective climate gradients. While steep growth reaction norms and increasing growth plasticity with latitude in M. menidia mimicked the strong, highly seasonal Atlantic coastal gradient, shallow reaction norms and much smaller, latitude-independent growth plasticity in A. affinis resembled the weak Pacific latitudinal temperature gradient.},

abstract = {Newly recruited juvenile gray snapper Lutjanus griseus were collected each fall for two consecutive years (2000 and 2001) from sites in Florida and North Carolina. Spawning, settlement, and growth patterns were compared across sites based on otolith microstructure. Larval otolith growth trajectories were generally similar for larvae from different sites and years; however, the mean pelagic larval duration (PLD) was 1 d longer for fish from North Carolina than for fish from the more southern sites. As a result, fish were larger at settlement to North Carolina. Estimated juvenile growth rates ranged between 0.62 and 0.88 mm/d and differed across sites and years, growth being generally faster at the southern sites. Water temperature accounts for some of this variability; however, site-specific differences in other factors probably contributed to some of the observed differences in growth. Back-calculated spawning patterns showed a lunar association with the new and first-quarter moons at all sites except for North Carolina. Settlement patterns were lunar cyclic as well: settlement pulsed during the third-quarter and new moons at all sites, and in North Carolina an additional pulse associated with the full moon was present. Patterns of larval and juvenile growth coupled with recruitment dynamics across the latitudinal gradient are consistent with northward Gulf Stream transport of larvae from southern spawning sites.},

abstract = {Lower temperatures, extreme seasonality and shorter growing seasons at higher latitudes are expected to cause a decline in metabolic rates and annual growth rates of ectotherms. If a reduction in the rates of these biological processes involves a reduction in fitness, then organisms may evolve compensatory responses for the constraints imposed by high-latitude habitats. To test the existence of a latitudinal compensation in ectotherms we used a common garden experiment to investigate the extent to which the level of energy turnover (measured as standard metabolic rate, SMR) and the energy budget (energy allocation to growth) are affected by climatic constraints in three populations of the land snail Cornu aspersum, distributed across a latitudinal gradient of 1300 kms in Chile. Our results did not support the existence of a latitudinal compensation in metabolic rates (Metabolic Cold adaptation). However, there was a countergradient variation (CnGV) for growth rate in which the highest latitudinal population exhibited greater growth rates than their counterparts from lower latitudes. Surprisingly, this CnGV pattern was accompanied by a lower apparent dry-matter digestibility, which could highlight a differential assimilation of ingested nutrients into somatic tissue, revealing enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal habitat. Our evidence highlights that adjustments in energy allocation to the digestive machinery and to protein storage could act as a latitudinal compensation for enhanced growth efficiency in snails from the highest latitudinal population.},

Ovaries of female Japanese eel and giant mottled eel adults were polycyclic, suggesting that freshwater eels can spawn more than once during a spawning season. The first collection of Japanese eel eggs near the West Mariana Ridge where adults and newly hatched larvae were also caught shows that spawning occurs during new moon periods throughout the spawning season. The depths where adults and newly hatched larvae were captured indicate that spawning occurs in shallower layers of 150-200 m and not at great depths.

It is suggested that oceanic regime shifts in the early 1970s, late 1980s and late 1990s occurred in the TWC region in winter, but the regime shifts in the mid-1970s and in the late 1980s were not evident in the spring SST anomaly series. The abundance and body size of Pacific saury fluctuated in association with the winter oceanic changes in the TWC region. The catch rates and abundance of large size saury were far bellow average during their northward migrations in the TWC region in the years with abnormally cool winters (e.g., 1963, 1970, 1977, 1981-1989 and 2006) and above average in the years with warm winters. These patterns demonstrate decadal-scale variations together with large inter-annual fluctuations in the structure and abundance of Pacific saury in association with the climatic-oceanic changes. These results, along with an alternation of dominant pelagic fish species, indicate the status of the saury population in the TWC region is in good condition, similar to that in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) region during the warm regime after the late 1980s climate regime shift.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of environmental conditions (controlled and natural) on the duration and sequence of developmental steps in sofie, Chondrostoma toxostoma, early ontogeny. Few previous studies on the early development of fishes have included relative growth and none have compared relative growth in the laboratory and the field. Such comparison is important to quantify the morphological development of different parts of fish during their early ontogeny, to determine potential variations in growth that may occur under laboratory conditions and to understand better the plastic nature of relative growth. Early development and relative growth of 23 characters were examined in specimens of sofie reared under both laboratory and natural conditions in tributaries of the River Garonne basin (France). The sofie is still present in this basin despite progressive localised extinction in the rivers of south western Europe over the last 30 years. Growth of field and laboratory embryos (in degree days, degrees days) was the same up to larva step 1 (9 mm SL), but thereafter was markedly slower in the laboratory than in the field. Ontogenetic rate in the field was twice that in the laboratory, suggesting a precocial (specialist) form under natural conditions and an altricial (generalist) form under laboratory conditions. Stabilisation of relative growth, i.e. end of the remodelling process (metamorphosis), occurred well after all larval characteristics (remnants of finfold, rapid allometric growth) had disappeared and all the juvenile structures had appeared (nasal septa, complete scale cover). In the field, this stabilisation occurred in specimens of approximately 50 mm SL, suggesting that metamorphosis ends and the juvenile period begins at the end of the sofie's first (0+) year of life.},

abstract = {Growth variability in 23 mensural characters was examined in 387 specimens of stone loach, Barbatula barbatula, from England. The standard length (SL) of the specimens ranged from 15.3 to 115.4 mm.We tested the hypothesis that body proportions change abruptly, rather than gradually, at certain intervals of ontogeny by fitting linear, quadratic and split linear curves to plots of each variable against SL. Based on patterns of allometric growth, two groups and two subgroups of mensural characters have been found. Three characters were best explained by a linear regression, indicating isometric growth. Eight characters were best explained by a quadratic curve, indicating gradual allometry. The remaining 12 characters were best explained by a split regression, indicating mainly isometric growth with abrupt allometry occurring at a specific SL (breakpoint). The first shift in morphometric values (a transformation of the head; breakpoints in three characters) occurred at 26–35mm SL, the second (a change in fin shape and size as well as body form; breakpoints in six characters) at 36–47mm SL. The coincidence of shifts in body morphology with those in microhabitat use (between the respective size classes) suggests that thresholds (though not as sudden as those between embryo and early larva steps) do occur during this interval of stone loach life history. We suggest that the larva period ends with the completion of the first shift in relative growth (i.e. not later than at 35mm SL, depending on individual variability), and that the second shift in morphometric values reflects a threshold between the first and the second step of juvenile period. The importance of changes in external morphology decreased as the fish grew bigger and older.},

abstract = {The ontogeny of schooling behaviour was studied in comparison to the development of sensory and swimming organs and taxis in carangid fish. Striped jack, Pseudocaranx dentex, larvae showed strong phototaxis at 3 days after hatching (3.5 mm in TL) when they developed pigmentation in the retina. Rheotaxis and optokinetic responses were apparent at 4.0-6.0 mm TL as larvae completed development of the basic structure of their eyes. A major inflection of allometric growth occurred at 9 mm, and fin ray formation was completed at these stages. Schooling behaviour, represented by one TL of inter-individual distance and parallel orientation, only appeared at 16 mm TL, and just prior to this behaviour, fish showed mutual attraction through vision at 12 mm TL. Canalization of buccal lateral lines was complete at 18 mm TL, whereas that of trunk lateral lines started at 23 mm TL and was complete at 30 mm TL. With these results, we assumed that critical factors of the ontogeny of schooling behaviour in carangid fish include not only the development of sensory or swimming organs, but also other factors such as development of the central nervous system. To show this, we reared another carangid species, the yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata, with dietary depletion of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), which is indispensable for the development of the central nervous system. Although DHA-free fish showed optokinetic response, they did not show schooling behaviour when they attained their schooling size. Tracer experiments using radioisotope labelled DHA showed that DHA is incorporated into the brain, spinal cord, and retina of juvenile fish. Under natural conditions, carangid fish larvae should intake enough DHA through diet to develop schooling behaviour, the fluctuation of dietary quality in zooplankton might therefore influence the development of indispensable antipredatory behaviour. Morphological changes of striped jack occurred in two steps; first at 9-12 mm (fin formation and inflection of allometric growth) and then second at 20-30 mm (scale and lateral line formation), and these changes corresponded with the development of schooling and recruitment to coastal waters, respectively. Since the onset of schooling is the first step of active antipredatory behaviour, we considered that 12 mm TL is the size at which they attain the juvenile period.},

abstract = {Age-0 brown trout, Salmo trutta, inhabit shallow and slow-flowing habitats where they can easily maintain stationary swimming positions. However, recent results have shown that they use deeper and faster habitats during daylight than at night, suggesting the occurrence of a nocturnal movement toward stream-margin habitats. Experiments were conducted to describe precisely when this diel pattern of habitat use appears during ontogeny. In two indoor channels, free-embryo brown trout were deposited under the gravel. When emerging, alevins were free to choose between margin (2 cm deep, 0-2 cm s(-1)) or deep habitat (12 cm, 2-4 cm s(-1)), or to leave the channel (upstream or downstream). During the week of emergence, upstream and downstream catches, fish habitat use (deep habitat or margin), and fish behavior (resting or swimming) were measured by direct observations and trap counts. Three treatments were performed: (1) fish artificially fed on drifting invertebrates, (2) fish exposed to predators (bullhead, Cottus gobio), and (3) control channels (no food, no predator). In control and food channels, a diel pattern of habitat use was observed 1-2 days after the emergence started. Most fish rested in the margin at night, whereas they moved towards the deep habitat during daylight to hold stationary swimming positions. In the presence of bullhead, most trout were cryptic, and visible fish stood in the margin during both daylight and at night. The importance of predation risk and foraging behavior on the ontogeny of the diel pattern of habitat use is discussed. Results support the direct development without larva from free-embryo via alevin in brown trout.},

abstract = {The morphology of minnows Phoxinus phoxinus from two rivers at the south-east of England was analysed on mensural characters and qualitative traits (occurrence of appendages, pattern of pigmentation and scalation). Eight developmental intervals were identified from the qualitative traits, and bivariate and multivariate analysis revealed that allometric growth occurs occasionally during ontogeny, mainly in earlier developmental periods. Body shape is under the influence of rapid increase during development, mainly due to the quick growth in early developmental intervals. The exclusion of 'general size', remarkable in early developmental intervals, revealed several 'shape' characters that mainly determine minnow morphology by changing the mode of variability during development (e.g. caudal characters, maximum body height, belly length and ventral head length). The tail certainly undergoes the most consistent and most durable change, its characters being the most variable and the most discriminative for developmental periods from larvae to adults. The most prominent alteration in the overall shape development occurs at the transition from larva to juvenile, both regarding the number of characters involved into the change and their variability. This transition takes place at about 28 mm SL, which corresponds to a significant change in microhabitat use in both the rivers Lee and Frome, characterized by shifts by 0+ juveniles to significantly deeper waters than those occupied by larvae, with increased amounts of either submerged filamentous algae (Lee) or vegetation (Frome).},

abstract = {To assess potential differences in predation impact on zooplankton communities by small (larva) and large 0+ juvenile fish, 18 studies were reviewed from fresh water and the brackish Baltic Sea of the northern hemisphere temperate region. These case studies were performed either in the field or in mesocosm experiments. Larva stocks were found to exert only minor impact on small zooplankton species such as rotifers, copepodids and small cladocerans. In contrast, stocks of 0+ juveniles were found to have the potential to depress populations of large cladocerans and copepods, especially during late summer and autumn. However, studies where both 0+ juvenile fish consumption and zooplankton dynamics and production were exactly quantified are still very rare, and therefore final evaluation of this interaction cannot be made. In addition, papers were summarized that describe differences in morphological and physiological performance between larva and 0+ juvenile fish. The greater impact of 0+ juvenile fish on large zooplankton may be explained by their larger mouth gape and by their better developed abilities to detect and consume their prey items. However, this partly is lessened by the lower energy requirements of juvenile fish compared with identical biomasses of fish larvae, although larva bioenergetics remains only fragmentarily understood. Consequently, selective predation by fish larvae on particular small zooplankton prey may be more important than has been detected so far.},

abstract = {The response of morphological, histological and endocrinological development to exogenous l-thyroxine (T-4) and to water depth during metamorphosis in Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus, was investigated. Exogenous T-4 was given in daily doses of 0.1, 0.05 ppm or a control treatment to halibut larvae at 550 daydegrees (posthatch, premetamorphic) for 14 days. Water depths of 40 cm, 10 cm or 1.5 cm were used to rear halibut larvae from 590 daydegrees for 21 days. Halibut larvae given exogenous T-4 at 0.1 ppm had accelerated eye migration relative to MH in fish given 0.05 ppm and in control fish. Pigmentation was correlated with dosage after 14 days. The volume of thyroid tissue was expressed in a dose-dependent manner and exhibited a size-dependency within each treatment. However, the follicles were atypical with reduced colloid, increased lumen and low epithelial cells even in the control group. The results indicate that T-4 is a mediator in halibut metamorphosis. In the water depth experiment, only cortisol levels of larvae reared in 1.5 cm water were significantly affected after 21 days, but this was not correlated with metamorphic rate. Hormone profiles, morphological changes and size suggest the existence of a 'window of opportunity' for metamorphosis in halibut extending from about 16 mm and tapering off about 21 mm},

@article{Balon1999,
abstract = {Lack of knowledge of early and juvenile development often makes it difficult to decide when a fish becomes a juvenile or, for that matter, a definitive phenotype. According to the established life-history model, a fish develops naturally in a saltatory manner, its entire life consisting of a sequence of stabilized self-organizing steps, separated by distinct less stabilized thresholds. Changes are usually introduced during thresholds. In principle, there are twoways to reach the juvenile period: by indirect or by direct development. Indirectly developing fishes have a distinct larva period that ends in a cataclysmic or mild remodeling process, called metamorphosis, from which the fishes emerge as juveniles. During metamorphosis, most temporary organs and structures of the embryos and larvae are replaced by definitive organs and structures that are also possessed by the adults. In contrast, directly developing fishes have no larvae. Their embryos develop directly into juveniles and do not need major remodeling. Consequently, the beginning of their juvenile period is morphologically and functionally less distinct than in indirect development. The life-history model helps to find criteria that identify the natural boundaries between the different periods in the life of a fish, among them, the beginning of the juvenile period. Looking at it from a different angle, when ontogeny progresses from small eggs with little yolk, larvae are required as the necessary providers of additional nutrients (‘feeding entities' similar to amphibian tadpoles or butterfly caterpillars) in order to accumulate materials for the metamorphosis into the definitive phenotypes. Directly developing fishes start with large demersal eggs provided with an adequate volume of high density yolk and so require no or little external nutrients to develop into the definitive phenotype. These large eggs are released and develop in concentrated clutches. It therefore becomes possible and highly effective to guard them in nests or bear them in external pouches, gill chambers or the buccal cavity. Viviparity is the next natural step. Now the maternal investment into large yolks can be supplemented or replaced by direct food supply to the developing embryos like, for example, the secretion of uterine histotrophe or nutrient transfer via placental analogues. When the young of guarders and bearers start exogenous feeding, they are much larger or better developed than larvae of nonguarders and the larva period in the former is reduced to a vestige or eliminated entirely. In the latter case, the juvenile period begins with the first exogenous feeding. Such precocial fishes are more specialized and able to survive better in competitive environments. In contrast, altricial forms retain or revert to a life-history style with indirect development and high fecundity when dispersal is advantageous or essential. Fishes become juveniles when the definitive phenotype is formed in most structures, either indirectly from a larva via metamorphosis or directly from the embryo},

abstract = {Two demersally-spawning fishes were selected to examine the relationship between adult spawning strategies and the early life histories of larvae and juveniles. Although the Caribbean gobies, Coryphopterus glaucofraenum Gill and Gnatholepis thompsoni Jordan are common, co-occurring constituents of nearshore coral reefs, relatively little is known about the early life history and recruitment of their pelagic larvae to the reef environment. To examine patterns of recruitment, recently settled juveniles (7.5 to 16 mm standard length, SL) were censused and collected biweekly from reefs of Barbados, West Indies, during the spring recruitment peak for 3 yr (March to June 1990 to 1992). Otolith analyses were used to determine larval durations and to back-calculate settlement patterns and spawning dates. G. thompsoni spent more than twice as long in the plankton (60 d) than did C. glaucofraenum (27 d). Variation in larval duration of G. thompsoni [coefficient of variation (CV)=22.4{\%}; durations up to 112 d] was significantly greater than that of C. glaucofraenum (CV=9.4{\%}), which suggests that G. thompsoni has a greater capacity for delaying settlement and metamorphosis. Estimated size at settlement for G. thompsoni (SL=8.4 mm) was significantly larger than for C. glaucofraenum (SL=6.4 mm), but post-settlement growth rates were virtually identical (0.21 to 0.22 mm d(-1)). Settlement of both gobies occurred predominantly around the third quarter moon (ca. Day 21 to 22), but there was much greater spread in the settlement of C. glaucofraenum. Back-calculated spawning frequency for C. glaucofraenum was not closely linked to the lunar cycle, whereas spawning of G. thompsoni occurred more frequently during the third quarter moon. These observations demonstrate that two confamilial demersal spawners may have larvae with contrasting life history traits which can influence patterns of juvenile recruitment. A secondary peak in larval duration of G. thompsoni approximately 1 mo after the major mode (Day 87) suggests that if settlement does not occur two lunar cycles after hatching, G. thompsoni larvae may delay settlement until the following third quarter moon. This coupling suggests that settlement during a particular lunar phase may be advantageous for new recruits, and the capacity to delay metamorphosis may enable tighter synchronization to the lunar cycle.},

abstract = {Growth and condition of larval Engraulis encrasicolus larvae in the Bay of Biscay were analysed relative to their biochemical composition. Protein, carbohydrate, lipid, DNA and RNA contents of larvae were quantified during larval ontogeny to analyse changes associated with growth. Proteins were the main organic component of E. encrasicolus at every larval stage, followed by lipids and carbohydrates. The increase in relative protein content in terms of protein percentage (P{\%}) and the decrease in lipid relative content (L{\%}) of the total organic matter (OM) with size observed are consistent with the definition of Type I larvae. Protein relative content increased until the P{\%} in larvae reached similar to 71 {\%}, whereas L{\%} and carbohydrate relative content (CH{\%}) declined, exhibiting minimum values of similar to 20, and similar to 6 {\%}, respectively. In general terms, the feeding condition of larvae, as defined by their RNA/DNA ratio, was good. Food did not seem to be a major factor limiting larval growth in the study area throughout late spring and early summer. The RNA/DNA ratio was size-related and increased during larval growth up to an asymptotic optimal value of similar to 3.6 in postflexion larvae in relative protein content, in terms of protein percentage (P{\%}). The 'actual' RNA/DNA ratios found in a given larval population when compared with the 'starving' RNA/DNA ratio, and using an 'absolutely optimal' value as complementary information, could be used to determine the overall status of the population. Parental effect of low egg quality is a possible explanation of delayed ontogenetical development of larvae from July 2000.},

abstract = {The young of many coastal fishes appear on estuarine nursery grounds in a progression of successive cohorts, few of which encounter identical environmental conditions. Using in situ manipulations, I explored the effects of natural environmental variability and use of a nursery habitat by prior cohorts on growth and mortality rates in successive larval cohorts of the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, a cyprinodontid fish common in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Variation in mean daily specific rates of growth (G = 0.027 to 0.143) and mortality (Z = 0.007 to 0.118) within and among cohorts was associated with the tidal cycle. Growth rate was positively associated and mortality rate negatively associated with the duration of tidal flooding experienced by groups of fish larvae. Tidal flooding may have affected growth and survival by controlling the renewal rate of prey resources (primarily harpacticoid copepods) in intertidal aquatic microhabitats where the fish larvae are normally found. Overall high survival (up to 90 {\%} after 2 wk) of larvae in experimental cohorts was attributed to the exclusion of predators from field enclosures. Successive cohorts of larvae were not nutritionally independent and use of the nursery habitat by a prior cohort usually had a negative ef f ect on survival of larvae in the next cohort. These findings challenge the general tenet that fish larvae are not food-limited in nurseries and suggest how variation in the physical environment can restrict food availability even in a highly productive estuarine habitat. The spawning pattern of F. heteroclitus seems to combine features from along a continuum of reproductive strategies exhibited by other marine fishes and may contribute to maintaining a large and stable population in a fluctuating estuarine environment.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary Clupeoid populations have undergone striking increases, followed by precipitous and catastrophic declines, which have caused the collapse of the fishing industry. These fluctuations have been caused by great natural variability in recruitment and by its interaction with fishing policy and economics. A probable combination of overfishing and natural changes also caused declines in other clupeoid stocks during the past few decades. Most clupeoids have a short life span; they recruit at 1-3 years of age and rarely live beyond 5-10 years of age except for some herring stocks, especially the Atlanto-Scandian herring. Early maturation implies that the asymptotic length (L∞) is reached rapidly and growth is not very significant in older fish. As a result most overfishing of clupeoids is classed as “recruitment” rather than “growth” overfishing. Nevertheless some classic cases exist of particular year-classes dominating a fishery for several years. In such cases, the importance of the year-class lies in its numbers rather than in the weight increase as the fish becomes older. The aim of this chapter is to describe the present status of knowledge on the behavior and physiology of clupeoids with particular reference to their ecology. Some of the advances have been made possible by improvements in the ability to rear larval stages and to catch, transport and keep the older stages in captivity, and by greatly improved techniques such as aerial photography, video systems, sampling gear, and apparatus.},

Percentages of larvae responding to the stimulus increased from 9{\%} 40 hours after eggs were spawned to a maximum of 95 plus or minus 4{\%} after 125 hours. Distances traveled in a given time period increased linearly with length so that maximum speed and mean speed similarly increased linearly with total length. The maximum distance traveled per burst was used as a measure of endurance and increased with length. These swimming speeds and endurance relationships can explain a large portion of size-dependent selectivity of towed plankton nets.},

The Wtted models reveal a double peak in spawning activity during early summer and autumn in the western Channel, a wider spring peak oV northern Spain and a broad winter season in the western and southern Ibe- rian Peninsula. At all sites, a high probability of spawning activity was observed over at least 3 months of the year, with the duration of the season increasing with both decreasing latitude and increasing Wsh size. Off western and southern Iberia there are indications that the spawning sea- son has been of longer duration in recent years for all size classes (reaching in some cases 8 months of the year for large Wsh). These patterns are in general agreement with existing literature and theoretical expectations of sardine spawning being driven locally by the seasonal cycle of water temperature, assuming preferences for spawning at 14 –15°C and avoidance for temperatures below 12°C and above 16°C. Regional quotient plots indicated that spawn- ing tolerance to higher temperatures increases progres- sively with decreasing latitude. Despite the weak evidence for geographical diVerences in temperature tolerance that may have some genetic origin, the degree of spatio-tempo- ral overlap in sardine-spawning activity within Atlantic European waters is unlikely to promote any reproductive isolation in that area.},

abstract = {Sardine and anchovy spawning was analyzed regarding its relation to sea-surface temperature and upwelling, using CalCOFI cruise data and Bakun's upwelling indices. Previous reports of temperature ranges for sardine and anchovy spawning have not taken into account the distribution of SST and have mostly referenced the cooler spawning area of the species. By obtaining the proportion of positive stations to total sampled stations for each tenth of a degree Celsius in the SST distribution, we were able to discriminate the ranges of preferred temperatures of spawning for both species. Sardines spawn in a much wider temperature range (13-degrees-25-degrees-C) than anchovy (11.5-16.5-degrees-C). Two maxima of spawning occur in the California Current: at 15-degrees-C and 23-degrees-C. An additional peak is present in the Gulf of California at about 19-degrees-C. Only one maximum is evident for anchovy spawning, at about 14-degrees-C. The distribution of spawning as a function of upwelling was also analyzed for both species. There is a maximum for sardines at intermediate values of upwelling. There are two maxima for anchovy: a minor one at low levels of upwelling and a major one at the maximum values of upwelling. We conclude that sardines are eurythermic as compared to anchovies, but spawn only at intermediate values of upwelling, whereas anchovies are stenothermic but spawn at much wider ranges of upwelling, particularly at low and high values. The differences suggest exclusive competition, but more detailed analyses are needed.},

In the coastal Gulf of Alaska, Pseudocalanus are present year round and are represented by three species. In 2001, Pseudocalanus mimus was the dominant Pseudocalanus species on the shelf during spring and summer, comprising 30–100{\%} of the total, while Pseudocalanus newmani dominated in Prince William Sound (10–90{\%}). Pseudocalanus minutus were only abundant in Prince William Sound during early spring. Egg production (by number and volume) was a function of female prosome length and decreased from spring to summer; however, significant variability was attributable to regional influences that were independent of size. For the same sized female, P. newmani produced more eggs per clutch than P. mimus. Pseudo- calanus mimus, however, tended to have a larger mean egg size than P. newmani. Consequently, clutch volumes of the two species were indistinguishable. Pseudocalanus egg production rates (EPRs) (eggs female–1 day?1) were lower in July and August (ca. 2–4) than April and May (ca. 1–9), but total egg production by the population (eggs day?1) was nearly equivalent for the two time periods due to higher female concentrations in summer.},

abstract = { Abstract Evidence of recent spawning by several species of marine$\backslash$neels of the families Congridae, Ophichthidae, and Nettastomatidae$\backslash$nwas found over the continental shelf along the coast of northeastern$\backslash$nJapan in October 2003. Sixty-three leptocephali of at least three$\backslash$ntaxa that ranged from 3.8 to 12.3 mm total length were collected$\backslash$nin a relatively small area, just to the south of Cape Shioya, primarily$\backslash$nover the 100-and 200-m-depth contours. The leptocephali of Gnathophis$\backslash$nnystromi nystromi were the most abundant, followed by those of G.$\backslash$nnystromi ginanago. This spawning area is located in an area that$\backslash$nappeared to include water originating from the Tsugaru Warm Current$\backslash$nand is further south than the typical latitude of the cold water$\backslash$nof the Oyashio First Intrusion. These findings suggest that some$\backslash$nspecies of marine eels may not migrate past the slope to spawn, and$\backslash$nthat the oceanographic features of the region may provide favorable$\backslash$nconditions for the growth and retention of leptocephali in the area$\backslash$nto the south of Cape Shioya. },

Larvae (n ¼ 20) were sampled during the period from 50{\%}hatch to first-feeding from four temperature treatments (c. 2, 4, 8 and 12 C). Data recorded included standard length, development stage, yolk-sac area and evidence of feeding by larvae. The results indicated that the stage of development at hatch was positively correlated to larval size. Furthermore, developmentally based changes in morphology shortly after hatch reduced much of the initial difference in size, although some difference still existed. No relationship between size at hatch and the incidence of first-feeding larvae was found. Based on these observations, it is recommended that the development stage of hatching larvae be reported in studies investigating size and morphological differences when observing individual larval fish that originate from different populations, batches or species.},

abstract = {Transport and survival of larvae of pelagic fishes in the Kuroshio system region were studied using Lagrangian drifter data recorded from 1990 to 2003. A large portion of the drifters from the Kuroshio area south of Japan spread around the Kuroshio Extension up to 170°E, while some moved south to the offshore area of the Kuroshio because of a recirculation gyre. The monthly mean eastward movement from areas south of Japan was approximately 800–900 km, which was smaller than previous numerical estimates. The results of a survival model assuming optimal temperatures for larvae suggest that surface waters during the observation period were too warm for larval Japanese sardine, which has an optimal temperature of 16°C, and the adult abundances did not increase during the observation period. In contrast, the spawning ground temperatures and transport conditions from an area south-west of Japan in April–June matched the requirement for the larval Japanese anchovy, which has an optimal temperature of 22°C. The combined effects of temperature variations due to seasonality and water mass mixing are suggested to play an important role in determining the environmental temperatures that occur in an area.},

abstract = {The mortality rates of Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax caerulea, larvae ({\textless} 20 d) increased during 1951-67, and this increase was positively correlated with the increase in biomass of northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax. Other potential correlates with larval sardine mortality rates were examined using multiple correlation. These included temperature and zooplankton volumes at stations positive for sardine larvae, water column stability, upwelling, transport, salinity anomalies, and Pacific mackerel, Scomber japonicus, abundance. None contributed significantly to the multiple regression with anchovy abundance. Thus, no evidence existed for either Lasker's stable ocean hypothesis of larval mortality or Hjort's larval transport hypothesis. The logarithm of the ratio of sardine recruits at age 2 to the spawning biomass was used as an index of recruitment success. Sardine recruitment success at age 2 was not correlated with larval mortality rates. Sardine recruitment, however, was negatively correlated with both northern anchovy biomass and the combined biomass of Pacific sardine, Pacific mackerel, and northern anchovy. A plausible explanation for this result is that predation by pelagic fishes results in greater mortality rates of sardine larvae and juveniles which in turn decrease sardine recruitment.},

abstract = {Growth and condition of larval Engraulis encrasicolus larvae in the Bay of Biscay were analysed relative to their biochemical composition. Protein, carbohydrate, lipid, DNA and RNA contents of larvae were quantified during larval ontogeny to analyse changes associated with growth. Proteins were the main organic component of E. encrasicolus at every larval stage, followed by lipids and carbohydrates. The increase in relative protein content in terms of protein percentage (P{\%}) and the decrease in lipid relative content (L{\%}) of the total organic matter (OM) with size observed are consistent with the definition of Type 1 larvae. Protein relative content increased until the P{\%} in larvae reached {\^{a}}ˆ¼71{\%}, whereas L{\%} and carbohydrate relative content (CH{\%}) declined, exhibiting minimum values of {\^{a}}ˆ¼20, and {\^{a}}ˆ¼6{\%}, respectively. In general terms, the feeding condition of larvae, as defined by their RNA/DNA ratio, was good. Food did not seem to be a major factor limiting larval growth in the study area throughout late spring and early summer. The RNA/DNA ratio was size-related and increased during larval growth up to an asymptotic optimal value of {\^{a}}ˆ¼3.6 in postflexion larvae in relative protein content, in terms of protein percentage (P{\%}). The 'actual' RNA/DNA ratios found in a given larval population when compared with the 'starving' RNA/DNA ratio, and using an 'absolutely optimal' value as complementary information, could be used to determine the overall status of the population. Parental effect of low egg quality is a possible explanation of delayed ontogenetical development of larvae from July 2000. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2008.},

Anchovy juveniles and larvae were found in only 6 of the 19 stations sampled. The ciliate communities were dominated by 2 species: Laboea strobila and Strombidium compressum. In the surface waters, the abundance of L. strobila ranged between 0 and 560 ind. l-1. S. compressum only appeared at Stns 15 to 18 (20 to 3300 ind. l-1). L. strobila was found mainly in the top 20 m. The abundance of L. strobila was less than 50 ind. l-1 in waters deeper than 25 m. S. compressum showed subsurface abundance peaks at the salinity abnormality. Tintinnids occurred occasionally with abundance lower than 100 ind. l-1. The total ciliate abundance fell in the range of 40 to 3420 ind. l-1. The ciliate biomass in the surface water and the water column ranged between 0.15 and 6.76 $\mu$g C l-1 and 0.4 and 134.4 mg C m-2, respectively. In the surface waters, the abundance of copepod eggs and nauplii ranged from 0.3 to 3.1 and 1.1 to 15.6 ind. l-1, respectively. The average abundance of copepod eggs and nauplii in 4 depth (0, 5, 10 and 20 m) fell in the range of 0.2 to 2.8 and 1.0 to 29.4 ind. l-1, respectively. As a food item of the E. japonicus post-larvae, the abundance of copepod nauplii and eggs appeared to be low. The abundance peaks of ciliate and E. japonicus post-larvae coincided. Although not found in the gut of E. japonicus post-larvae, aloricate ciliates might be ingested by first-feeding anchovy larvae, preventing initial starvation and prolonging the time to irreversible starvation. On the basis of dilution experiments with positive microzooplankton grazing rates, microzooplankton grazed at rates of 0 to 0.61 d-1. Grazing pressure of microzooplankton on chlorophyll a standing stock (Pi) and potential chlorophyll a primary production (P p) were 17 to 46{\%} and 35 to 109{\%} d-1, respectively.},

abstract = {Fish recruitment can vary by an order of magnitude between years, and the larval stage is a key determining factor. Zooplankton, the main source of larval food, are temporally and spatially heterogeneous, and this could contribute to recruitment variability and ultimately stock sustainability. Here we use simple stochastic models of larval growth and zooplankton dynamics, together with an evolutionary algorithm, to investigate the role of transient peaks in zooplankton abundance and the match/mismatch hypothesis in recruitment success and variability. We draw four main conclusions. (i) Stochasticity in individual growth is more beneficial to recruitment when larvae experience high food availability early on in their growth. (ii) When the timing of peak prey abundance is stochastic, recruitment probabilities are greatest for hatching days just before the expected timing of peak prey abundance. (iii) When the timing of periods of high prey density is held fixed, the evolved optimum hatching day becomes earlier as the length of the high density period increases. (iv) When both the timing and length of the periods of high density are allowed to (co-)vary, we find no evidence of strong selection pressure for specific hatching days, only for a hatching "window" around the expected prey peak.},

abstract = {The use of river-types is of practical value, serving as groups for which assessment procedures can be developed and applied. An abiotic typo- logy was set by the Portuguese Water Agency, mainly based on 6 major morphoclimatic regions. However, to be biologically meaningful, this typo- logy should fit the distribution patterns of the biological quality elements communities proposed in Water Framework Directive under the lowest possible human pressure. This study aimed to identify and characterize fish-based geographical groups for continental Portugal and their environ- mental and geographical discriptors, using taxonomic and functional traits. Sampling took place between 2004 and 2006 during Spring. Fish fauna from 155 reference sites was analysed using a multivariate approach. Cluster Analysis on fish composition identified 10 fish-groups, expressing a clear correspondence to the river basin level, due to the restrict basin distribution of many species. Groups showed a wider aggre- gation in 4 regions with a larger geographical correspondence, statistically supported by Similarity Analysis, both on fish composition and mostly on fish metrics/guilds. Principal Components Analysis revealed major envi- ronmental drivers associated to fish-groups and fish-regions. Fish-groups were hierarchically grouped over major and local regions, expressing a large-scale response to a North-South environmental gradient defined by temperature, precipitation, mineralization and altitude, and a regional scale response mainly to drainage area and flow discharge. From North to South, fish-regions were related to the morphoclimatic regions. Results contributed to reduce redundance in abiotic river-types and set the final typology for Portuguese rivers, constituting a fundamental tool for plan- ning and managing water resources.},

abstract = {We developed an ecological model to characterize the structure and functioning of the marine continental shelf and slope area of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, from Toulon to Cape La Nao (NWM model), in the early 2000s. The model included previously modeled areas in the NW Mediterranean (the Gulf of Lions and the Southern Catalan Sea) and expanded their ranges, covering 45547 km2, with depths from 0 to 1000 m. The study area was chosen to specifically account for the connectivity between the areas and shared fish stocks and fleets. Input data were based on local scientific surveys and fishing statistics, published data on stomach content analyses, and the application of empirical equations to estimate consumption and production rates. The model was composed of 54 functional groups, from primary producers to top predators, and Spanish and French fishing fleets were considered. Results were analyzed using ecological indicators and compared with outputs from ecosystem models developed in the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Cadiz prior to this study.

RESULTS
showed that the main trophic flows were associated with detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. Several high trophic level organisms (such as dolphins, benthopelagic cephalopods, large demersal fishes from the continental shelf, and other large pelagic fishes), and the herbivorous salema fish, were identified as keystone groups within the ecosystem. Results confirmed that fishing impact was high and widespread throughout the food web. The comparative approach highlighted that, despite productivity differences, the ecosystems shared common features in structure and functioning traits such as the important role of detritus, the dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and the importance of benthic-pelagic coupling.},

abstract = {We draw inferences about the dynamic processes responsible for the dispersal of ichthyoplankton on small marine banks using physical and biological data derived from static point-estimates of water-mass characteristics and ichthyoplankton collected concomitantly on the central Scotian Shelf. Where the density field evolves slowly and ageostrophic forcing is weak, the near-surface geostrophic flow can be derived from hydrographic data using the dynamic height method modified for shallow seas. We assess our interpretations of larval distributions using simple particle tracking. The hydrography of the Scotian Shelf during November of 1997 was typical of late autumn, when density is determined by surface variation in salinity. Surface isopycnals generally paralleled isobaths, and there was no evidence of strong surface fronts. Sizes of larvae of pelagic origin (e.g. cod and hake) on Western Bank (sole spawning source) increased and became skewed towards larger animals (cod, 3-10 mm; hake, 5-15 mm) in water-mass (Temperature and Salinity) space along isopycnals, consistent with gradual mixing and limited transport in the geostrophic flow (i.e. retention). Conversely, larvae of benthic origin (e.g. herring, 6-25 mm) were distributed across water-mass space, consistent with multiple origins and substantial transport. Our results indicate that dispersal from small, low-energy marine banks results from the interaction of spawning location, geostrophic currents and bathymetric steering, and requires neither convergence nor larval behaviour.},

abstract = {Controlled feeding experiments with juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai were performed to evaluate the suitability of stable isotope analyses for diet inference. Juvenile abalone were divided into five sire groups with distinct isotopic ranges caused by different dietary regimes before the experiments. Three different foods were provided for 42 days: a benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium (BD), a macroalga Laminara japonica (MA), and a formulated pellet (FP). For the FP diet, the smallest juvenile group [8.3 mm in mean initial shell length (SL.)] showed significant changes in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios from the natural diet within approximately 1 wk. Using final tissue-diet isotopic differences in the two largest juvenile groups for the FP diet, the fractionation values wen: estimated as 1.6 parts per thousand and 2.2 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and delta N-18, respectively. An exponential decay function of the change in delta C-13 with time indicated that the shortest period to complete equilibrium fractionation was {\textgreater} 120 days. Given the estimated fractionation values. the major diets of juvenile abalone (1.9-6.9 mm in SL) in the field were inferred to be benthic microalgae and several red macroalgae.},

abstract = {The occurrence of newly settled postlarvae ({\textless}500 mu m of shell length [SL]) and subsequent growth and survival of the abalone, Haliotic diversicolor. were observed from 2001-2004 at two stations in the rocky shore of Nagai on the coast of Sagami Bay, Japan. Seawater temperature, current velocity, and distance of the weekly stone movement were monitored at both stations to determine factors affecting survival and growth of postlarvae. There were newly settled postlarvae in August and September of 2001, October 2002, August 2003, and September 2004. A total of 6 cohorts were identified between 2001 and 2004. Initial density of each cohort was generally higher at Station 1 than Station 2, but recruits at Station l had greater mortality than Station 2. Results from measurements of the physical environmental factors suggested that higher mortality rate of postlarval and juvenile H. diversicolor at Station I were produced by greater water turbulence and stone movement caused by storms. Growth rates in the first month after settlement varied between cohorts (35-62 mu m SL day(-1)), and growth rates were slower for cohorts settling later in the spawning season and experiencing lower water temperature. The timing of typhoon-triggered spawning in H. diversicolor population was also Suggested to be an important factor affecting growth and survival of post larvae and early juveniles, along With their subsequent recruitment. The cohorts from 2001-2004 attained 17-40 mm SL in about one year after settlement. To estimate the size and age at the first stage of maturation, the increase in shell length and gonad development of a single cohort from 2001 were measured. This cohort attained 30-55 mm SL and showed high gonad index at 22 mo after settlement, indicating the first stage of maturation of H. diversicolor is achieved at age 2.},

Compositions of prey items of the three species in the same month showed greater similarity than for the same species in different months. Prey size as well as prey taxa of the three species overlapped considerably with one another. Therefore, interspecific prey competition is likely in the case of limited food availability. The most abundant species tended to change from anchovy to round herring in early winter, from round herring to sardine in late winter and from sardine to anchovy in early spring, indicating a temporal segregation in use of the nursery grounds. Similar seasonal changes in growth rates were observed for the three species. Although interspecific prey competition is likely, the temporal segregation and similar temporal changes in growth rates could favor their coexistence.},

abstract = {Studies on the feeding habits of postlarval abalone in their natural habitats have never been carried out primarily because of the lack of an investigating tool. In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C and delta(15)N) were tested to detect nutritional sources during the early life stages of the abalone Haliotis discus hannai in laboratory experiments to evaluate stable isotope analyses as an appropriate investigative tool for field studies. Fertilized eggs, larvae, and the parent spawner muscle were analyzed to detect a nutritional source during the nonfeedine period. The delta(13)C of fertilized eggs showed slight depletion, about 2 parts per thousand, compared with that of the parent muscle, and was not detectable after lipid extraction of fertilized eggs. As for the larvae, the isotopic values in postlarvae after settlement and metamorphosis were 2 parts per thousand more enriched, become similar to that of the spawner muscle. These results imply that the lipid portion of the eggs is the primary nutritional source during the nonfeeding period of abalone. Laboratory feeding experiments were conducted during which early postlarval abalone (approximately 1 mm in shell length (SL)) were reared for 7 days and supplied with 4 benthic diatoms respectively. The benthic diatom Cylindrotheca closterium produced high growth and survival rates for early postlarval abalone, and there was a significant isotopic shift in their delta(13)C, approaching that of C. closterium. Larger postlarval abalone (SL, {\textgreater}1.3 mm) were fed 1 of 5 benthic diatoms and a gametophyte of a macroalga, Undaria pinnatifida, for 21 days. Isotopic changes approaching. the delta(13)C of the provided benthic diatoms were detected from postlarvae fed the benthic diatoms Achnanthes longipes, Cocconeis scutellum, C. closterium, and the gametophyte of U. pinnatifida, which provided high survival rates and growth rates for the postlarvae. From these results, stable isotope ratios of postlarval abalone are suggested to be useful to infer the origin of the assimilated diets. The current study highlights that stable isotope ratios are a promising tool to investigate the diet composition of postlarval abalone in their natural habitat as well as in abalone hatcheries.},

abstract = {The subarctic Oyashio Current flows south-westward and the subtropical Kuroshio Current flows north-eastward in the western North Pacific, converging in the waters off northern Japan to form the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region. Some small pelagic fishes inhabit the subarctic or subtropical waters, and others seasonally migrate north and south across the major ocean fronts. Environmental conditions in the subarctic and transition waters are variable, whereas in the subtropical Kuroshio waters conditions are relatively stable. Latitudinally different environmental conditions may affect vital parameters and recruitment variability of small pelagic fishes inhabiting the various waters. Pacific saury Cololabis saira migrate seasonally from the Kuroshio to Oyashio waters and spawn in the transition waters in autumn and spring and in the Kuroshio waters in winter. During 1990-1999, the coefficients of variation (CVs) of daily growth rates (G) and instantaneous mortality coefficients (M) were large for larvae and juveniles spawned in the northern transition waters, but relatively small for those from the southern Kuroshio waters. The Pacific stock of chub mackerel Scomber japonicus spawns in the Kuroshio waters in spring and early summer and migrates to the subarctic Oyashio waters in summer for feeding, whereas the Tsushima Warm Current stock spawns in the East China Sea in spring and fish remain in the subtropical warm waters throughout their lifetime. The Pacific stock had CVs {\textgreater} 100{\%} for the fish aged 0-5 during 1970-2002. In contrast, the Tsushima Warm Current stock had CVs of 34-40{\%} during 1973-2002. Pacific herring Clupea pallasii, which inhabits subarctic waters, had CVs of 118-178{\%} for the fish aged 3-8 y during 1910-1954. Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus, which spawn in the subtropical Kuroshio waters and migrate to the subarctic Oyashio waters in summer for feeding, had CVs {\textgreater} 120{\%} for the fish aged 0-4 during 1976-2003. Contrasting with these subarctic Oyashio associated species, subtropical round herring Etrumeus teres had a CV of 26{\%} over the total catch during 1976-2003. For these small pelagic fishes, latitudinal variation in early life parameters and recruitment was evident at the levels of cohorts (C. saira), stocks (S. japonicus), and species (Clupeidae). Large variations were observed in the subarctic Oyashio and the Oyashio-affected transition waters, whereas relatively stable results were recorded for the subtropical Kuroshio and its branch, the Tsushima Warm Current. Because the cohorts of Pacific saury and stocks of chub mackerel are not genetically distinct, it is likely that the large variability in the northern waters was environmentally induced in these species. The differences in CVs among clupeids are probably the result of differences in specific reproductive strategies and the environmental characteristics of the waters inhabited by the different species.

abstract = {Small pelagic fish have exhibited cyclic population dynamics in complex marine ecosystems worldwide. These fish regime shifts have been associated with ocean regime shifts; however, the biological mechanisms have remained unresolved and have been considered to depend mainly on multi-step processes through food webs. In the present study, we focus on species-specific temperature optima and show that similarities and differences in spawning temperature optima reflect those in the long-term population dynamics among multi-species pelagic fish in the western North Pacific. Spawning temperature optima were examined for anchovy, sardine, mackerel and jack mackerel, based on the occurrence of eggs and larvae, using a long-term (1978 to 2004) data set of egg and larval surveys off the Pacific coast of Japan. Anchovy exhibited a plateau-like spawning temperature pattern with a peak at ca. 22 degrees C. In contrast, sardine and mackerel exhibited steeply peaked patterns with marked peaks at ca. 16 and 18 degrees C, respectively. On the contrary, jack mackerel showed a very similar spawning temperature pattern to anchovy. These relationships were consistent with their flourish and collapse in long-term population dynamics. Furthermore, sardine and mackerel with stenothermal spawning patterns showed dramatic fluctuations relative to anchovy and jack mackerel with more eurythermal features.

abstract = {Numerical particle-tracking experiments were performed to investigate the transport and variability in environmental temperature experienced by eggs and larvae of Pacific stocks of the Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) and Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) using high-resolution outputs of the Ocean General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator (OFES) and the observed distributions of eggs collected from 1978 to 2004. The modeled anchovy individuals tend to be trapped in coastal waters or transported to the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region. In contrast, a large proportion of the sardines are transported to the Kuroshio Extension. The egg density-weighted mean environmental temperature until day 30 of the experiment was 20-24 degrees C for the anchovy and 17-20 degrees C for the sardine, which can be explained by spawning areas and seasons, and interannual oceanic variability. Regression analyses revealed that the contribution of environmental temperature to the logarithm of recruitment per spawning (expected to have a negative relationship with the mean mortality coefficient) was significant for both the anchovy and sardine, especially until day 30, which can be regarded as the initial stages of their life cycles. The relationship was quadratic for the anchovy, with an optimal temperature of 21-22 degrees C, and linear for the sardine, with a negative coefficient. Differences in habitat areas and temperature responses between the sardine and anchovy are suggested to be important factors in controlling the dramatic out-of-phase fluctuations of these species.},

abstract = {Anchovy and sardine populations have fluctuated alternately with decadal changes in climatic and oceanic states, although the mechanisms remain unclear. In the western North Pacific, anchovy and sardine share nursery grounds in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transitional waters, where the subtropical and subarctic currents converge from the south and north, respectively. We found that northward expansion of the subtropical waters simultaneously changed the local environment in the nursery grounds to be favorable for late larvae and early juveniles of anchovy, but not for those of sardine during 1996-2002. Increased temperature enhanced growth and survival for anchovy, whereas reduced food availability diminished those for sardine. Northward expansion of the subtropical waters have been linked with wind-forced anomaly of sea-surface height in the central North Pacific. After 1988, when anchovy flourished and sardine collapsed in the western North Pacific, previous studies by other researchers documented similar changes in air-sea interaction. Our results suggest that contrasting responses in growth and survival processes to wind-forced oscillation of the current structures caused the alternate population dynamics between anchovy and sardine in the western North Pacific.},

abstract = {Stage duration and growth rate during the late larval stage can be key parameters of recruitment dynamics in the Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonius in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region of the western North Pacific. The developmental rate was defined as a reciprocal of the duration in days of the metamorphosing stage, and was a positive function of the growth rate after the onset of metamorphosis. The growth rate after the onset of metamorphosis in the early juvenile stage fish corresponded with higher growth rates in the early metamorphosing stage fish. The results indicate that larvae with a faster growth rate during the late larval stage metamorphosed at a younger age than the larvae with a slower growth rate, Developmental and growth rates were faster in the southwestern waters than in the northern and eastern waters in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region. Survival during metamorphosis depends on the developmental and growth rates, and we conclude that the larvae with faster developmental and growth rates in the southwestern waters had a higher probability of successful metamorphosis and recruitment to the spawning stock, and constituted the major part of the population of E. japonicus in the Kuroshio -Oyashio transition region.},

abstract = {Relations between the long-term variations in numbers of Japanese sardine and in ocean/climate were studied. We examined long-term records of the spring air temperature on the north-western coast of North America (ATNA; 40–50°N, 130–110°W) reconstructed from tree rings, and the sardine catch records inferred from documents dating from 1600 to 1990. High sardine catches occurred eight times in this period, and each high catch continued for 7–45 years. We found a significant difference in mean ATNAs between the abundant and poor catch periods: high (low) catch occurred in periods of high (low) ATNA. ATNA was negatively correlated with spring sea-surface temperature east of Japan (SSTJ; 36–40°N, 150–160°E), where the sardine possibly migrate north-eastward, a relation which was confirmed from 1940 to 1990. In years when the Aleutian Low Pressure System (AL) shifted south-east and intensified, the westerly wind was strong east of Japan along the south-western edge of the AL, resulting in low SSTJ; a warm south-westerly wind blows in the west coast of North America along the south-eastern edge of the AL. If we assume that this relation between ATNA and SSTJ can be extended back to the 1600s, high (low) catches occur in the period when SSTJ is low (high). This relation between sardine catch and SSTJ is consistent with previous studies based on data from after 1900. The present results suggest that long-term variations in Japanese sardine are related to interdecadal North Pacific ocean/climate variability.},

abstract = {Relationships between otolith and somatic sizes were examined for Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus and sardine Sardinops melanostictus larvae collected broadly in the western North Pacific, based on a substantial data set derived from a previous paper. Allometric formulae showed close fits to the relationships between otolith radius and standard length, and the formulae differed between anchovy and sardine larvae. Despite the high correlations, the effect of somatic growth rate on the otolith and somatic size relationship (the 'growth effect') was significantly detected for both anchovy and sardine larvae. Slower growing larvae tended to have larger otoliths than faster growing conspecifics at the same somatic size. This growth effect was more obvious for sardine larvae than for anchovy larvae, probably because of their differential responses of somatic growth to temperature shifts. The growth effect could lead to the possibility of biases in the back-calculation and size estimation processes. As the growth effect is considered to be a general phenomenon and its extent to be species-specific, the relationship between otolith and somatic size and its uncoupling should be scrutinized before application of techniques based on the otolith and somatic size correlation.},

The differences between the left and right sides of sagittal otoliths in terms of surface area (SA), perimeter (PM), major axis length (MJ) and minor axis length (MN) were measured in juvenile anchovies shortly after metamorphosis. The absolute values of the side differences were used as the FA index for the 4 traits. Size dependence of the FA traits upon standard length (SL) was eliminated by reducing the SL range centering on the mean value. The distribution patterns of the FA traits were statistically equivalent to those of FA. The FA values for SA and PM had a significant negative correlation to the mean growth rates obtained from the otolith daily ring information. In MJ and MN, although the correlation was not significant, FA and the mean growth rate seemed to be in a negative relationship, the latter limiting the upper border of the former. FA analyses using otolith traits have been shown to have the potential to determine condition of the Japanese anchovy.},

abstract = {Environmental variability and growth-rate histories from hatching to capture were investigated for larval Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) and Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus). Larvae collected around the front of the Kuroshio Current were examined using otolith microstructure analysis, and their movement was estimated from numerical particle-tracking experiments. Sardine larvae collected inshore of the Kuroshio front originated from a coastal area near the sampling site, while those collected in the offshore area originated from an area 500-800 km west-southwest of the sampling site. Anchovy larvae collected both inshore and offshore had been transported from widely distributed spawning areas located west of the sampling area. At the age of 13-14 days for sardine and 19-20 days for anchovy, the offshore group exhibited significantly higher mean growth rates than did the inshore group. Although the offshore area was generally warmer than the inshore area, temporal variations in growth rate are not attributable solely to fluctuations in environmental temperature. While previous studies have examined the relationship between larval growth rates and environment based solely on data at capture, the methods used in the present study, combining otolith analysis and numerical particle-tracking experiments, utilize data up until hatching. Although the relationship between growth rate and environment was not fully confirmed, this approach will greatly advance our understanding of fish population dynamics.},

abstract = {To elucidate the external cues triggering spawning of Haliotis diversicolor, changes in the gonads of adults and the occurrence of newly settled post-larvae were monitored from 2001 to 2004 in Sagami Bay, Japan. The gonad index (GI) and gonad somatic index (GSI) of both sexes began to increase between April and June 2002, peaked in September, and then decreased significantly by early October. In other years, GI and GSI were significantly lower in autumn. Between June and September in each year, almost all females had a mature ovary and most were capable of spawning, but the occurrence of newly settled post-larvae ({\textless} 500 mu m in shell length) was strictly limited to the periods just after typhoons passed through the study area. The GI and GSI of both sexes also decreased significantly only after typhoon events. Although mature adults experienced various changes in seawater temperature, tidal height and lunar phase during the survey periods, evidence of spawning was observed only after typhoon events. There were no specific trends in seawater temperature and lunar phase before newly settled post-larvae were collected. Our results suggest that spawning of H. diversicolor is strongly associated with typhoon events. Most individuals had an immature ovary just after the passage of a typhoon. However, 1 mo after spawning, most individuals had a mature ovary with a high GI, suggesting that H. diversicolor requires an interval of about 1 mo between successive spawning events.},

abstract = {During periods when the population size of Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicusis large, the abundance of 1-yr olds has been considered to be dependent on the growth and survival processes in the late larval and early juvenile stages in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region off northern Japan. Recent growth rates for 10 days before capture of larval and early juvenileE. japonicus were estimated and examined in relation to the surface water temperature and the available copepod density in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Late larval and early juvenile E. japonicus were distributed in the waters with temperature from 15 to 19C and available prey density from 10 to 1000 mg dry weight (DW) m)2 in the transition region. The late larval growth rates were found to be regulated more strongly by water temperature than by copepod density in the waters {\textless}16C, and more strongly by copepod density than water temperature in the waters {\textless}100 mg DW m)2 in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region. The recent growth rates decreased from the western waters to the eastern waters in the survey area 140-170E in 1998, correlating with decreases of food availability to50-100 mg DW m)2. While in 1999, the recent growth rates were faster in the waters east of 150E, resulting fromeastward expansion of warm water ranges and high available prey density 100-400 mg DW m)2. The key environmental factors regulating late larval growth rate of E. japonicus in the transition region seem to be spatially different between years.},

abstract = {Climate variability influences fishery production in a variety of ecological processes. There are increasing concerns with ecosystem level impacts of climate variability on fisheries. To understand climate effects on abalone fishery, two climate indices, Arctic Oscillation Index (AOI) and Aleutian Low Pressure Index (ALPI, were compared to abalone catch fluctuations in Hokkaido and Miyagi regions in Japan, affected by the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) and the Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents (KOC), respectively. The species compositions and trophic structures of benthic communities in natural habitats of abalone Haliotis discus hannai were investigated at Iwanai (Hokkaido) and Tomarihama (Miyagi) coasts. The long-term catch fluctuations were closely related with AOI and ALPI for Hokkaido and Miyagi, respectively. Species replacement from a competitor gastropod Homalopoma amussitatum to a congener H. sangarense was detected in Tomarihama, showing that the latter is non-competitive with juvenile abalone. Species interactions appeared different, possibly affecting recruitment success: favourable [weak competition and weak predation] at Tomarihama and unfavourable [strong competition and strong predation] at Iwanai, setting up a hypothesis for the recent notable catch increase in the KOC region. This study highlights that climate variability could influence benthic fisheries by changing species interactions in a benthic ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The community and trophic structures of the subtidal habitat of the abalone Haliotis diversicolor were examined in Nagai, Sagami Bay, Japan. Conventional community indices showed no significant differences among three sampling stations. The overall continuum of stable isotope ratios was structured into three different trophic linkages: (i) brown algae-dependent benthic food chain; (ii) red algae-dependent benthic food chain; and (iii) planktonic food chain. Brown algae and red algae likely play different roles with respect to carbon sources in the habitat. Conventional fractionation values indicated that the abalone H. diversicolor (delta C-13 = -12.4 +/- 1.0 parts per thousand, delta N-15 = 9.3 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand) feeds on the lamina of Undaria pinnatifida during juvenile and adult stages (8.0-65.6 mm shell length). Stable isotope signatures suggested that the juveniles of other abalone species as well as some amphipods and a sea cucumber Holothuria decorata are competitors of H. diversicolor, whereas some Muricidae gastropods such as Thais bronni and Ergalatax contractus are predators. The isotopic differences among macroalgal species and the subsequent transfer to consumers indicate that stable isotopic analysis is an effective means of studying food webs in an open rocky shore community with little influence from external primary production such as terrestrial vegetation.},

abstract = {To elucidate the effects of delayed metamorphosis and delayed post-settlement feeding on larval competence and post-larval survival and growth in the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor, we examined three sets of experiments. First, a pebble coated with crustose coralline algae (CCA) was used to induce competent H. diversicolor larvae to metamorphose at 2, 5,8,12, or 17 days (Group A) or 2,6, 10, or 12 days (Group B) after fertilization. To observe spontaneous attachment and metamorphosis, some larvae from Group B were maintained without the addition of a CCA-coated pebble. Rapid metamorphosis was observed in older larvae of both CCA-induced groups; 2 days after the addition of the CCA-coated pebble, 50-75{\%} of the 2-day-old larvae and more than 85{\%} of the 5-12-day-old larvae had metamorphosed. The percentage of spontaneously metamorphosed individuals increased 14 days after fertilization, reaching 50.6 +/- 16.7{\%} (mean +/- S.E.) at 18 days. Second, metamorphosed post-larvae that had experienced larval periods of 5, 8, 11, or 15 days (Group A) or 4, 7, or 10 days (Group B) were reared at 26 degrees C with or without the benthic diatom Nitzchia ovalis as the sole food source. The survival and growth rates of the fed post-larvae in both groups decreased with the length of the larval swimming period; of the post-larvae from larvae of more than 7-11 days old, fewer than 70{\%} still survived 16 days after metamorphosis. Mean growth rates during the 6 days after metamorphosis were lowest for the post-larvae from the larvae with the longest period of swimming. Third, newly settled post-larvae from 2-day-old larvae were reared at 26 degrees C with delays of 0, 3,6,9, or 12 days before first feeding (N. ovalis). Feeding delays of longer than 6 days dramatically depressed post-larval survival rates: approximately I week after the onset of feeding, more than 65{\%} and fewer than 20{\%} of the larvae subjected to feeding delays of 0-3 days or 6-12 days, respectively, still survived. These results indicate that H. diversicolor is more susceptible to the detrimental effects of delayed metamorphosis and delayed post-settlement feeding than are the larger abalone species Haliotis discus hannai and Haliotis iris.

abstract = {Oogenesis of abalone Haliotis discus hannai was examined histologically during a single spawning season using broodstock of various maturation conditions, which were controlled by effective accumulative temperature (EAT). The quality of eggs spawned was determined in relation to oogenesis. For histological examinations, three to five females were sacrificed at 300, 600, 850, 1050, and 1150 degrees C days EAT, without induction of artificial spawning. Other females were successfully induced to spawn at 700 degrees C days EAT and were reared following spawning. Three of these females were then sacrificed every 200 degrees C days EAT until 1300 'C days EAT. Gonad histology showed that two oocyte cohorts matured in H. discus hannai ovaries during a single spawning season. One mature oocyte cohort could be spawned in multiple times. The second oocyte cohort started developing after the first oocyte cohort had been spawned or reabsorbed, and became fully mature 400 degrees C days EAT after the first cohort was depleted. For egg quality measurements, three to five females were successfully induced to spawn at 850, 1050, 1150, 1900, and 2350 degrees C days EAT (Experiment 1). Three females were induced to spawn twice, at 700 and 1500 degrees C days EAT, resulting in two batches of eggs from the same individuals (Experiment 2). Total lipid and protein content of eggs were measured and were greater in eggs from the second cohort than in eggs from the first cohort. No carbohydrates were detected in eggs and there was no difference in cytoplasm volume between the two cohorts. In hatcheries producing H. discus hannai, it is important to increase post-larval starvation tolerance by increasing the quality of eggs, to yield higher and more consistent survival. The results of this study suggest that H. discus hannai hatcheries should use eggs from the second oocyte cohort, which are of higher quality, rather than eggs from the first oocyte cohort.

abstract = {The effects of deposited sediments on the settlement of the abalone Haliotis diversicolor Reeve were examined through both field observations and a laboratory experiment. Occurrences of newly settled post-larvae (shell length {\textless}500 mu m) and the amount of suspended and deposited sediments were monitored at two stations (Stns 1 and 2), which experienced different sediment deposition conditions, located at Nagai on the coast of Sagami Bay, Japan. Quantities of suspended sediments at the two stations varied considerably during the survey period, but no significant difference was detected between the stations. Mean volume densities of sediments deposited on cobbles were significantly higher at Stn 2 than at Sm 1. Densities of newly settled post-larvae from the 2001 to 2004 cohorts were significantly higher at Stn 1. A laboratory experiment was conducted to assess the effects of sediment quantity and quality on larval settlement. Two substances with different physical properties, kaolin and clamshell powder, were used as sediments. Larvae were subjected to four different sediment treatments with crustose coralline algae (CCA) substrates; thin and thick treatments for both kaolin and clamshell powder. Negative (without CCA) and positive (with CCA) controls without sediments were also established. The rate of metamorphosis decreased as sediment thickness increased in both the kaolin and clamshell powder treatments. Larvae in the kaolin treatments appeared to be trapped by the kaolin, and most could not metamorphose successfully. There were no trapped larvae in the clamshell powder treatments. The results indicate that the quantity and physical properties of sediments deposited on substrata affect the settlement and behaviour of larval abalone. Experimental results suggest that the lower densities of newly settled post-larvae observed at Stn 2 may have been a result of larger quantities of deposited sediments, which reduced the availability of suitable substrate for larval settlement.

Although older juveniles are known to use back-reef seagrass beds as a potential nursery habitat, information is scarce regarding pre-settlement larvae. Using light traps anchored on the reef slopes at seagrass-replete and seagrass-free reefs (lshigaki Island, Japan), lethrinid larvae were sampled weekly from April to June 2008. Larval abundance in light traps was similar on the 2 reef types. This result implies that lethrinid larvae did not or could not differentiate between the presence or absence of seagrass before settlement. However, in the laboratory, larvae collected from both reef types selected seagrass substrate rather than bare substrate or coral. In underwater visual censuses, newly settled juveniles were not observed on the seagrass-free reef, whereas they were abundant on the seagrass-replete reef. Together, these findings suggest that lethrinid larvae did not settle near the seagrass-free reef but rather preferentially settled near the seagrass-replete reef.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the habitat preferences of top shell, Turbo cornutus, in settlement and post-settlement stages. Competent larvae were strongly induced to settle by five species of articulated coralline algae, three species of gelidiacean algae and an unidentified crustose coralline alga, when. the algae were provided separately. Although a clear difference in the settlement percentage was not found between an articulated coralline alga, Marginisporum crassissima, and the crustose coralline alga in the no-choice experiment, a significantly greater percentage of top shell larvae settled on M. crassissima than on the crustose coralline alga when larvae could select algal fragments to settle in the choice experiment. In contrast, larvae did not show a settlement preference among articulated coralline algae species in either the no-choice or choice experiments. Aggregation behavior of juveniles of two size classes were observed; the juveniles aggregated with all three algal fragments tested (M. crassissima, a crustose coralline alga, and the brown alga Dictoya dichtoma) when each algal fragment was provided Separately. When the three algae were provided together, juveniles of both size classes preferred the articulated coralline alga M. crassissima over the other two algae. The experimental results indicated that the specific distribution of top shell juveniles in coralline algal turfs in their natural habitat is determined by a combined preference for articulated coralline algae in the settlement and post-settlement stages.

abstract = {We investigated the relationships between stock biomass, distribution area and mean density of sardine and anchovy populations off California, Peru, South Africa and Japan. Our objective was to elucidate whether their ecological responses to habitat availability and use would support the possibility of them developing synchronic, alternating biomass fluctuations. Results indicate that as populations of both species grow in size, both the area they occupy and their packing density increase, generally consistent with the basin model. The relationship between distribution area and stock biomass is allometric, which implies that there is a limit to the stock expansion to new areas. Patterns of space occupation appear to differ between sardine and anchovy in some regions. In South Africa and Japan anchovy occupies larger area per unit biomass than sardine, consistent with habitat requirements as determined by their feeding ecology. Off California and Peru results confirm that in general species expand their distribution area with stock size, but specific patterns are less clear. Reasons for this are discussed, including sampling biases, the role of upwelling in limiting anchovy's habitat off Peru, the ability of sardine to use offshore habitats off California, as well as possible differential space occupation patterns during population growth and decline. It is suggested that habitat availability may not be a pre-requisite for sardine growth in some areas, while anchovy may require habitat to become available for populations to grow. The differential habitat dependency and use of space between both species suggests that they cannot be considered to ecologically replace each other. While differences in space utilization may provide opportunities for diverging population paths, the ecological mechanisms behind out-of-phase fluctuations may be much more complex than a simple replacement. The results provide the first comparative, quantitative estimates of biomass/area relationships for pelagic fish, of use in models investigating the potential for expansion and contraction of anchovy and sardine populations worldwide based on climate change-driven habitat predictions.

In the first half of the 20th century, large amounts of spawning herring were caught by set nets at coastal spawning grounds off the coast of Hokkaido, Japan. Using the catch data, we analyzed the mean length at age with respect to sea-surface temperature and density-dependent growth during the years 1910 to 1954 by generalized additive modeling (GAM). This stock is distributed at the southern boundary of the distribution range of Pacific herring, and we thus hypothesized that high temperatures have a negative effect on growth. Our study shows that length of Hokkaido spring spawning herring is highly dependent on growth during the first years of life and on temperatures preceding and during the feeding season. Higher temperatures during winter have a negative effect on growth. We found only weak indications of density-dependent growth in the stock of Hokkaido spring spawning herring.},

abstract = {We tested whether the predation dynamics of chub mackerel Scomber japonicus and spotted mackerel S. australasicus on young anchovy Engraulis japonicus relates to individual growth characteristics of the prey and could account for the growth-selective survival predicted by recruitment hypotheses. Juvenile and adult mackerel were sampled along with their young anchovy prey field in 2004 ( juvenile mackerel and larval anchovy) and 2005 ( adult mackerel and juvenile anchovy) off the Pacific coast of Honshu, Japan. The recent 5-day mean growth rate of larval and juvenile survivors and prey found in the stomach of mackerel was estimated from the otolith microstructure. No significant difference was found between the recent growth of larval or juvenile survivors and that of preyed individuals. We conclude that despite a relatively small body size, the high activity level and predation skills displayed by mackerel prevent fast-growing larvae and early juveniles from benefitting in terms of the expected survival advantage over slow-growers. Hence, growth-selective predation mortality of larval fish would depend on the feeding ecology of the predator rather than predator size. Selection for fast growth is more likely to occur under predation pressure from invertebrate organisms and small pelagic fish specialized on zooplankton, such as herring and anchovy.},

Because the spatial distribution of marine fish larvae immediately prior to settlement versus during settlement was unknown, field experiments were conducted at Ishigaki Island (Japan) using light trap sampling and underwater visual belt transect surveys to investigate the spatial distribution patterns of selected pre- and post-settlement fishes (Acanthuridae, Pomacentridae, Chaetodonidae and Lethrinidae) among four habitats (seagrass bed, coral rubble, branching coral and tabular coral). The results highlighted two patterns: patterns 1, pre- and post-settlement individuals showing a ubiquitous distribution among the four habitats (Acanthuridae) and pattern 2, pre-settlement individuals distributed in all habitats, but post-settlement individuals restricted to coral (most species of Pomacentridae and Chaetodontidae) or seagrass habitats (Lethrinidae). The first pattern minimizes the transition time between the larval pelagic stage and acquisition of a benthic reef habitat, the latter leading immediately to a juvenile lifestyle. In contrast, the second pattern is characterized by high settlement habitat selectivity by larvae and/or differential mortality immediately after settlement.},

Using the observed relationship between L and wet body weight (W), W=0.00942 L-2.99, W of the sardine juveniles was calculated to increase from 306 to 832 mg during the 20-day period, The carbon (C) requirement to achieve this growth in weight was estimated to increase from 5.7 to 9.6 mg day(-1). Stomach contents of the sardines were composed mostly of copepods (73{\%}) and larvaceans (35{\%}). Wet stomach content weight (W-s) was expressed by a power function of the W, W-s=0.731 W-0.658. Carbon and nitrogen constituted 41.7 +/- 1.5 and 10.0 +/- 0.4{\%} of the dry W-s, respectively. Stomach C content increased from 2.0 to 3.9 mg during the 20-day period. Three to four cycles of the daily turnover of stomach contents during the 16 h of daytime, corresponding to a gastric evacuation rate of 0.2-0.3 h(-1) under continuous feeding, met the C requirement to achieve the backcalculated growth in early juvenile sardines.

abstract = {The goals of this study were to measure vertical distributions of pelagic coral reef fish larvae, identify significant vertical migrations, and estimate the effects of vertical migrations between depths with different ambient currents on larval transport in the Straits of Florida. Spring, summer, and fall time-series of plankton net tows were conducted at the edge of the Florida Current offshore of Miami. In each time-series the upper 100 m of the water column at a fixed station was sampled repeatedly at 3-h intervals for two diel cycles, with different nets sampling at five discrete depth ranges. Simultaneously, currents-at-depth were recorded by shipboard current profilers. Mean and standard deviation of larval depth and statistically significant vertical migrations were determined by nonparametric resampling and tree regression techniques. In 10 taxa, larvae showed ontogenic vertical migrations, gradually moving deeper with growth and development. Vertical distributions of six taxa varied between day and night, revealing diel vertical migrations. Larval transport was estimated by generating progressive vector diagrams from current measurements and larval vertical distributions. The dominant alongshore component of the Florida Current resulted in rapid larval transport through the Straits of Florida, while cross-shore current was an order of magnitude weaker and highly variable. Larvae at depths {\textgreater} 70 m experienced a 15-75{\%} reduction in transport; thus, deep vertical distributions and downward vertical migrations potentially favor retention and settlement in the Straits of Florida.},

The karyotype of both populations has 48 acrocentric chromosomes and agrees with the one reported by Ohno el al. (1968), probably from the central population. The common chromosome number, the entirety of their chromosomes of uni-armed type, the agreement in their C-banding pattern and the absence of statistically significant differences between the lengths of the chromosome pairs of both populations, do not provide features that could be considered distinctive of the populations analyzed.},

abstract = {A reliable representation of physiology in models of larval fish is essential to understand how environmental factors affect growth rates. In particular, individual-based models of larval fish typically contain detailed bioenergetic modules that couple energy intake, temperature and body conditions to growth. These modules rely on experimental studies for their formulation and parameterization, although for many species this information is still scattered and a constraint to model development. Here, we develop a bioenergetic model including gut flow, assimilation efficiency and metabolic costs of Engraulis mordax larval anchovy based on available experimental work and field observations, and use it to investigate individual growth under different daily feeding rations and frequencies, and temperature. At satiated feeding and similar temperature-conditions, the model predicts growth rates comparable to field estimates of E. encrasicolus (but higher than observed for E. japonicus), suggesting E. encrasicolus grow near their physiological, temperature-limited rates in the field.},

abstract = {Determining the extent of dispersal in exploited marine fishes is essential for understanding their population dynamics and optimising management. The West Australian dhufish, Glaucosoma hebraicum, is a highly sought-after, large and long-lived reef-dwelling species, endemic to south-western Australia. Stock assessments indicate that this indicator species is overexploited. The fishery is managed using a zone-based system, which implicitly assumes a high degree of demographic independence among zones. While tagging studies indicate limited movement of adult G. hebraicum, there is no understanding of the spatial scale of dispersal of its larvae and thus the true extent of interdependence of management zones. We analysed 13 microsatellite DNA loci to characterise the extent of gene flow, and conducted particle tracking simulations to model larval transport in this species. Genetic data demonstrated that some local recruitment was likely, but that on a broad scale gene flow between the management zones was extensive, and the entire fishery represents a single genetic stock. Hydrodynamic modelling predicted that the majority of dhufish larvae recruit from within the management zone where they are spawned, and that inter-annual variation in current velocities has limited effect on the extent of larval transport. Because management zones are likely to be largely independent in terms of both larval and adult recruitment, heavy localised fishing pressure has the potential to reduce the abundance and reproductive capacity of this species in highly fished areas, but it should have limited impact on neutral genetic diversity.},

Their mean abundances were 108 eggs.10 m(-2) and 112 larvae.10 m(-2). The spawning areas were mainly located off the 100 m isobaths, with the maximum abundance occurring near the shelf break, as opposed to the inshore waters where anchovy eggs and larvae were practically absent. Depth was the main factor controlling the distribution of anchovy eggs and larvae. Larval transport from the spawning areas is made evident following southward to south-eastward directions.},

abstract = {The construction of a rule-based model aimed at assisting in the management of the Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis by predicting the success of recruitment is described.  Of the many environmental variables which, potentially, may give an indication of future recruitment, the fundamental physical indices of sea surface temperature and wind were selected for inclusion in the model.  From simple regression and correlation analysis, qualitative rules were constructed relating recruitment success to wind frequency, wind velocity and sea surface temperature in one or more of the spawning, transport and recruitment (nursery) areas of the anchovy.  By calibration of the rules, and the consideration of annual spawner biomass, it was possible to obtain a good estimate of observed recruitment.  The model was then used to examine the implications of a number of possible environmental scenarios on annual recruitment.  Results from the statistical analyses and those from the model indicate that transport of larvae may be one of the dominant components of the Benguela system that affects anchovy recruitment.  Furthermore, simulated recruitment emphasizes the high within-season variation in recruitment.},

abstract = {Several published models exist for simulating vertical profiles of pelagic fish eggs, but no one has rigorously assessed their capacity to explain observed variability. In this study, we applied a steady-state model, with four different formulations for vertical diffusivity, to northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) eggs in the California Current region. Vertical mixing profiles, based on wind speed and hydrography, were combined with estimated terminal ascent velocities of the eggs based on measurements of egg buoyancy and size, to simulate the vertical profiles of the eggs. We evaluated model performance with two data sets: (1) vertically stratified tows for both species and (2) paired samples for sardine eggs from 3-m depth and in vertically integrated tows. We used two criteria: whether the model predicted individual observed vertical profiles (1) as well as the observed mean and (2) better than the observed mean. Model predictions made with the formulation producing the most gradual profile of vertical diffusivity provided the best match to observations from both data sets and for both species. Addition of a random error term to the terminal ascent velocity further improved prediction for anchovy eggs, but not sardine. For the paired data, model prediction of integrated abundance from abundance at 3-m depth had significantly lower mean square error than prediction based on a linear regression of 3 m on integrated abundance. Our results support the feasibility of using data from the Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler quantitatively as well as qualitatively in stock assessments.},

abstract = {Norwegian spring-spawning herring larvae (Chipea harengus L.) were reared at different temperature combinations in the laboratory, and marked twice with a fluorescent dye, alizarin complexone, to estimate otolith growth and increment deposition rate. A daily increment deposition rate was confirmed in the sagittae of larvae reared at 12 degreesC from day 16 (first marking age), while the apparent rate of increment formation of larvae reared at 4 degreesC was clearly less than one per day. A reduction in rearing temperature from 12 to 8 degreesC between days 16 and 30 (second marking age), significantly affected sagitta growth during the inter-mark period compared with those reared at 12 degreesC throughout. Similar somatic growth rates were observed in both groups temporarily reared at 8 degreesC between markings (about 6{\%} day(-1)), but the otolith growth rate was more than four times higher in the group originating from 12 degreesC compared with the one originating from 4 degreesC. The body size versus otolith size relationship was temperature dependent, and larvae originating from different temperature regimes could be distinguished based on the differences in otolith growth pattern, but not based on differences in body size alone. The temperature-dependent otolith growth in herring larvae is expected to be of major importance for the observed differences in otolith microstructure patterns of herring stocks from different environments and regions in the field. However, this may be difficult to document in situations when larvae have low otolith growth and clear increment patterns are not present.},

abstract = {Larvae of most aquatic species experience high mortality in the plankton and where traits are naturally variable, mortality can be selective. We tested the hypothesis that reef fish larvae with faster growth rates and larger size-at-age will be more likely to survive the pelagic larval period. We examined the otolith microstructure of larval bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum collected across the Straits of Florida to obtain daily growth rates and relative size-at-age. Using a cross-sectional approach, we compared these traits between 2 larval age groups (young larvae: 18 to 26 d old, survivors: 27 to 36 d old) to determine whether mean traits varied with age. In contrast to expectations, survivors had slower early growth and were smaller-at-age than the young larvae, suggesting that faster growing, larger individuals were selectively removed from the population over time. To examine the role of water masses, we estimated maximum upstream larval positions. Differential current speeds across the Straits of Florida resulted in substantial overlap in back-estimated upstream locations of larvae at younger ages, suggesting that differences in early growth environments were unlikely the cause of the observed patterns. Instead, the most parsimonious explanation is the selective loss of fast-growing, large-at-age larvae in the plankton. Shifts in the direction of selective pressures across stages may contribute to the maintenance of high plasticity in the early life history traits of this species.},

abstract = {Six age-prediction models based on otolith size (weight, length, and width) and fish size (standard length, SL, and weight) were developed for juvenile Baltic cod Gadus morhua (SL, 40-153 mm; age, 90-230 d). Models were built based on stepwise selection and compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Reference age was estimated by counting the growth increments in the transverse sections of sagittal otoliths (n = 310). Final comparison of the utility of the six models was based on the AIC. The best model included SL, fish weight, and sampling month as independent variables. Sampling month was added to account for differences in fish growth, after it was shown that otolith size at age was related to differences in somatic growth. The predicted age of all juveniles collected between 1991 and 1995 was used to estimate their hatch dates and growth rates. The average growth rate was 0.78 mm d(-1) when estimated from predicted ages (1990-1995; n = 2036) and 0.73 mm d(-1) when age based on direct increment enumeration was used (1990-1993; n = 3 10).

abstract = {The Gulf of Lions is one of the main anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) spawning areas in the NW Mediterranean. During the spring, low-salinity surface water from the outflow of the Rhone is advected by the shelf-slope current along the continental slope off the Catalan coast. In June 2000, a Lagrangian experiment tracking these low-salinity surface waters was conducted to assess the importance of this transport mechanism for anchovy larvae and to determine the suitability of the tracked surface waters for survival of anchovy larvae. The experiment consisted of sampling the tracked water parcel for 10 days with three drifters launched at the core of the shelf-slope current where low-salinity surface waters were detected. The survey was completed by sampling the surrounding waters. Anchovy larvae from the spawning area in the Gulf of Lions were advected towards the south in the low-salinity waters. The size increase of anchovy larvae throughout the Lagrangian tracking closely followed the general growth rate calculated by otolith analysis (0.65 mm day(-1)). However, advection by the current was not the only mechanism of anchovy larval transport. A series of anticyclonic eddies, originated in the Gulf of Lions and advected southwards, seemed to play a complementary role in the transport of larvae from the spawning ground towards the nursery areas. These eddies not only contributed to larval transport but also prevented their dispersion. These transport and aggregation mechanisms may be important for anchovy populations along the Catalan coast and require further study.},

abstract = {The temporal and spatial patterns of larval settlement of the bluehead wrasse, Thalasoma bifasciatum, were documented in the San Blas Islands of Panama. Daily censuses indicated that larvae settle onto coral reefs in brief episodes that tended to occur around the new moon and peak in intensity between August and December of each year. The magnitude of settlement each day was unrelated to changes in the local population size but was found to be significantly correlated with the nightly catch of planktonic reef fish larvae in the waters over the reef. The spatial pattern of settlement was examined on three scales. On a large geographic scale, 24 reefs within 1000 km2, there was tremendous variability in settlement intensity that was very consistent from one year to the next. The best correlate of recruit density was exposure to the onshore current. It is suggested that some large?scale oceanographic process determines the intensity of settlement of bluehead wrasses on this scale. The densities of adults on these reefs directly reflected the densities of recruits. Counts of daily otolith increments indicated that those larvae that settled onto low?density reefs subsequently grew significantly faster. On an intermediate scale, sites within 1 km2, there was no consistency among sites or months in settlement intensity, suggesting that variance in settlement intensity on this scale may be the product of random processes. On the smallest scale, habitat selection within a patch reef, it was found that recruits had distinct preferences in their choices of settlement sites. The daily mortality schedule of bluehead wrasses indicated that mortality was extremely high for the first 3 d on the reef. Juvenile mortality was, furthermore, found to be independent of density. As a result, the patterns of larval settlement of bluehead wrasses persisted into the adult population relatively unchanged. It is therefore proposed that the distribution and abundance of bluehead wrasses in this region are more a product of the external processes controlling larval settlement than of any biological interactions within the reef assemblage.

abstract = {The stock of North Sea autumn spawning herring Clupea harengus (L.) has shown an unprecedented 10 yr sequence of sharply reduced recruitment, in spite of a high spawning bio-mass. Recent work has identified this below-expected recruitment as being determined during the larval phase: however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this study we analysed archived larval samples captured before and after the onset of the reduced survival to test the hypothesis of a concurrent change in the larval growth rate. Individual larval growth rates, averaged over the 21 d prior to capture, were estimated for similar to 200 larvae from 4 different years using a model-based analysis of otolith ring widths. Hydrographic backtracking models complemented the otolith analysis by reconstructing the environmental history and spawning origin of each larva. A significant reduction in net larval growth rate of 8{\%}, concurrent with the reduced larval survival and recruitment, was identified: after correcting for the effect of other explanatory variables (e. g. temperature changes), the gross reduction was found to be 12{\%}. This reduction is most probably due to changes in either the amount or quality of available food. The study demonstrates the potential of coupling 2 different techniques for affording new insights into fish early life history: otolith microstructure analysis and hydrographic modelling. Finally, the study provides a novel indication of the association between reduced growth and larvae survival, thereby narrowing the range of potential mechanisms underlying the observed reduction in the recruitment of North Sea autumn spawning herring.},

abstract = {The mid-latitude area of the Central Pacific is sensitive to ocean environmental change because latitudinal fluctuation in a transition zone between subtropical and subarctic waters has played an important role in climatic change in East Asia, the North Pacific and North America. Higher amounts of pollen and spores were found in core H3571 on the Hess Rise during the glacials than during the interglacials. Pollen originating from broadleaf deciduous forest in warm and humid environments as well as from boreal conifers and tundra/park-tundra in cold and wet environments occurred during the glacials. The boreal conifer pollen such as Tsuga, Picea, and Haploxylon could originate from the central Japanese archipelago, that Ephedra was supplied from the Asian continent, and that the main source regions for the rest of the pollen and spores were from the southern Japanese archipelago to the area around the East China Sea. Therefore, ocean current transportation was important for the transportation of pollen and spores to the Hess Rise. This evidence demonstrates a small southward shift in the Kuroshio Extension during the glacials. it also suggests that terrestrial organic matter (OM) deposited in the open sea may also be transported by ocean currents, reflecting coastal terrestrial environments, although it is widely believed that terrestrial OM in open sea sediments is of aerosol origin.

Larval transport was simulated using a finite-volume advection-diffusion model (Delft3D-WAQ) coupled-to a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model (Delft3D-FLOW). Model parameter settings were refined following a sensitivity analysis. Validation of modelled hydrodynamics and larval distribution patterns showed broad agreement with field data. Differences in model results for larval distribution, transport success and timing of arrival at nursery grounds between baseline conditions and a scenario that incorporated a proposed 1000 ha coastal reclamation (protruding 6 to 7 km from the Dutch coastline) for the expansion of the Port of Rotterdam (Maasvlakte-2) were insignificant in comparison to the interannual variability in larval dispersal for these species. Results suggest that effects of the proposed coastal reclamation on the transport success of fish larvae (flatfish and herring), an issue over which public stakeholders had expressed concern, will be negligible.},

abstract = {Three different assumptions of the otolith-somatic growth relation were simulated using an individual-based bioenergetics model. The LINEAR model assumed that otolith growth was directly related to somatic growth; the TEMP-WT assumed that otolith growth was a function of ambient temperature and the weight of the fish; and the O2CON model assumed that otolith growth was a function of oxygen consumption. Although the LINEAR model resulted in an otolith radius-total length relation most often observed in nature (linear), otolith growth in the model ceased at temperatures and food rations that curtailed somatic growth, which contradicts some other studies. Model otolith growth continued at temperatures and ration levels that curtailed somatic growth in the TEMP-WT and O2CON model, however the resulting otolith radius-total length relation from the O2CON model was not as similar to naturally occurring ones. In all three models slower growing fish had larger otoliths than did faster growing fish of the same size when somatic growth was food limited. However, in the TEMP-WT and O2CON models, faster growing fish had larger otoliths when growth was limited by temperature. Different geometries between the fish body and otolith resulted in different growth rates between the two structures in terms of length, despite the fact that their growth rates in terms of weight were identical. This implies that a comparison between somatic and otolith growth needs to consider and specify the dimensions involved. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Precursors for the Indian monsoon are known to be highly epoch specific in their skills in predicting the monsoon on seasonal time scales. We show that the various precursors are correlated with the monsoon, only when they are correlated with ENSO, which happened in the recent period 1951 - 1990, but not in the 1990's and the period 1911-50. This accounts for the skill in monsoon prediction during 1951-90. We find that ENSO and its precursors tend toward higher amplitude and 3 - 5 year periods in the 1951 - 1990 epoch, and toward decreased amplitude and 5 - 7 year periods in the 1911 - 1950 epoch. We argue that the shift to lower frequency and amplitude in the earlier epoch diminished the association between the monsoon precursors and ENSO, leading to diminished skill in predicting the, monsoon in that epoch. However, the simultaneous relationship between the monsoon and ENSO has been stable over the past 140 years, suggesting that the monsoon - ENSO teleconnections are robust once ENSO is established. Changes in the frequency of ENSO have implications for statistical prediction schemes for ENSO and the monsoon.},

abstract = {The degeneration of postovulatory follicles (POFs) in time and at different temperatures was studied for the Bay of Biscay anchovy. For this purpose a key of 7 POF stages, solely defined on the basis of their histological degeneration characteristics, was applied. The novelty of this procedure is (hat it separates staging of POFs from their ageing process. The female gonads, taken from several captivity experiments and field samples, were classified ill this way. Water temperature in captivity tanks corresponded to high values (17-21 degrees C), except for one case in which different day and night temperatures were applied. In addition, 472 field samples ( 11948 anchovy females) from several cruises were examined: of these, 126 samples (3348 females) were identified as coming from areas of hi h sea surface temperature (weighted mean =17.76 degrees C, s.d.=0.84) and 13 1 samples (3181 females) as, coming from areas of low sea Surface temperature (weighted mean =14.42 degrees C. s.d.=0.75). There was close agreement in the Succession of POF stages over time after spawning between the experiment and the field samples. The first four stages of POF degeneration occurred in less than 24 h, and by the end of the first day the POFs were mainly in Stage V. Stages VI and VII showed their highest occurrence during the first and second half of the second day after spawning, respectively. Full resorption of POFs was achieved in about 55-60 h. For the range of temperatures examined (13-19 degrees C), little effect of temperature oil the degeneration of POFs over time was noticed. The advanced degeneration stages were found all day round, showing some overlapping periods when Successive spawning cohorts co-occurred. The application of these results for ageing POFs is discussed.},

abstract = {The development of a periodic, spatially structured population matrix model for the study of North Aegean Sea anchovy population structure and dynamics is presented on the basis of its life-cycle, and the ecosystem environmental features. System heterogeneity and species life-cycle leaded to model development on seasonal scale and sub-regional basis, incorporating survival, fecundity and migration rates. Several methodological aspects concerning the periodic dynamics on a seasonal basis combined with the existence of spatial heterogeneity and age-season specific migration patterns are examined and discussed. Special attention is devoted to a possible inflow of recruits originated from Black Sea Waters, introducing a "source-sink" effect in the model and resulting in reducible projection matrices. The model also accounts for a possible outflow from the study area, structurally implemented by another virtual "sink" sub-area incorporation. A first attempt was made to calibrate the model using parameters provided by older studies and original data provided by the ANREC project focused on the anchovy-environment interactions and carried out in the area. Then the model was used to check the efficiency of various fishing limitations in space and/or time and the results confirmed the importance of the fishing activity over the spawning grounds.

abstract = {Anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus, L.) is one of the most important commercial species of the northern and central Adriatic Sea. The mean annual catch of anchovy estimated by IRPEM for these areas, in the time interval 1975-1996, is equal to 25,000 tonnes. Estimates of anchovy stock biomass at sea in the time interval 1975-1996 were obtained using two population dynamics methods based on different data inputs: Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) and the DeLury model with recruitment index. VPA was carried out tuning the estimated fishing mortality rate at age by fitting on corresponding Catch Per Unit of fishing Effort (CPUE). Both VPA and the DeLury model yielded sensible results. The effect on the assessments due to the use of a different birth date and thus of split-year data was investigated. Biomass values as well as patterns over time so estimated were similar on the basis of both assessment methods and calendar year versus split-year data. In particular, the biomass in more recent years (around 100,000 tonnes) was lower than in the second half of the 1970s and first half of the 1980s (over 200,000 tonnes). The minimum value (lower than 50,000 tonnes) was always estimated in 1987, when a strong drop in the catch and crisis of the anchovy fishery took place. Though high values of both fishing effort and fishing mortality/exploitation rate were obtained for some years before 1987, very low levels of recruitment in 1986 and 1987 seem to be mainly responsible for the collapse of the stock.},

abstract = {There is controversy concerning the location of spawning sites and recruiting routes of Japanese anchovy in the northeastern Taiwan. Early in the larval fish fishery season, we conducted a survey along a presumptive coastal current to IIan Bay with the aim of obtaining anchovy larvae for demographic analysis. The obtained samples of the Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus, were analyzed to elucidate the species' directional tendency, which was from offshore to inshore, and which reached coastal IIan Bay along the western boundary of the Kuroshio Current during late April. Demographic analysis indicated that offshore anchovy larvae had the smallest body size, and that the size increased from offshore toward the coastal. Based on the sagittal microstructural analysis, detailed early life history traits, such as increment size, standard length and body weight at daily ages were back-calculated, then various relationships were estimated, and significant differences were shown to have an offshore-coastal tendency. Estimated developmental stability exhibited highest variation in transitional inshore area and lowest variation in coastal area. The mean daily growth rate in standard length was 0.28 mm d(-1) for larvae in the offshore area and 0.54 mm d(-1) for those in the coastal area. However, the inshore larval population exhibited a non-steady growth pattern, which was 0.27 mm d(-1) corresponding to an offshore environment during a period of 7-24 April, but had a subsequent higher growth rate of 0.59 mm d(-1), whose value was similar to that of the coastal population. These findings combined with local flow pattern and sea surface temperature images support the hypothesis that anchovy larvae are transported from offshore at Pangaiyu to the coastal area of the IIan Bay, along with a previously identified coastal current in northeastern Taiwan waters. Coastal area of IIan Bay serves as an important nursery ground for late anchovy larvae.},

During 2001 and 2002, we released satellite-tracked drifting buoys in eastern Lake Michigan to follow discrete water masses, and used ichthyoplankton nets to repeatedly sample larval fish within these water masses. Observed nearshore water currents were highly variable in both direction and velocity. Current velocities far exceeded potential larval fish swimming speeds, suggesting that currents can potentially rapidly advect fish larvae throughout the lake. Evidence suggests that while paired drifters released during 2002 were able to track relatively small alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) larvae within an alongshore coastal current., paired drifters released during 2001 failed to track larger alewife larvae when flow was more offshore and highly variable. These results are consistent with the decorrelation scales associated with alongshore and offshore transport.},

Otoliths of juveniles with a standard length (SL) 23.1-53.0 mm were marked with Alizarin complexone and the fish were held in the laboratory for 66 days at 14, 20, 24 and 29 degreesC while being fed ad libitum. The mean somatic growth increased with temperature from 0.1 mm SL day(-1) at 14 degreesC to 0.3 mm SL day(-1) at both 24 and 29 degreesC. The maximum observed somatic growth rate was 0.7 mm SL day(1) at 29 degreesC. The number of micro-increments formed in otoliths was not significantly different from the expected value, validating formation of one increment per day. The significant relationship between increment width and somatic growth rate can be used to estimate Somatic growth rates of individual wild fish based on daily increment information in their otoliths.

Three groups of juveniles were distinguished based on differences in hatch season, otolith size and growth history, and body morphometrics. As T. japonicus has different spawning seasons according to spawning grounds, each group was estimated to hatch in different waters. Juveniles with W(t) otoliths were considered to have stayed in coastal habitat longer, as the hatch area was estimated to be near Wakasa Bay. Juveniles with W(o) and G(o) otoliths appear to recruit to coastal waters at larger size, since their hatch areas were estimated to be far from each collection area. Larger otoliths of W(t) were attributed to otolith accretion after the second growth flexion, which was observed only for W(t). Standard length of W(t) fish at the second otolith growth flexion was estimated to correspond to recruitment size to coastal rocky reefs in Wakasa Bay. Body morphometrics were correlated with otolith size after removing body size effect, suggesting that morphological variations of T. japonicus juveniles were also associated with the timing of recruitment to coastal habitat.},

abstract = {The diet of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus was studied in three regions (Bejaia, Benisaf and Ghazaouet) along the Algerian coast. Ontogenetic, spatial and seasonal variations in anchovy diet were investigated using multivariate analyses and analysed in relation with sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a. 46 prey taxa of varying size between 0.57 mm (Euterpina acutifrons) and 6.8 mm (fish larvae) were recorded. Whatever the season, the region or the fish size, anchovy is exclusively zooplanktivorous and copepods were the most present prey, constituting 87{\%} by number of the prey taken and found in 98{\%} of the anchovy stomachs examined. However, their occurrence and number varied according to the different areas, seasons and fish size. During its first year of life, anchovy feeds almost exclusively on copepods (mainly small and medium size prey). As anchovy grows, copepods are gradually substituted by large crustaceans such as decapods and amphipods. Hierarchical cluster analysis, analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) and similarities percentage (SIMPER) indicated a distinct diet of anchovy of the bay of Bejaia from those of the bays of Benisaf and Ghazaouet probably due to differences in hydrologic conditions. Diet differences also occurred between seasons. Summer and spring have distinct prey assemblages each and showed low diet similarities with the two other seasons. More prey species were found in the diet during winter (36) and autumn (30) and the vacuity index was lower in winter. Temporal variability in satellite-derived chlorophyll-a matched the seasonal variability in the diversity of the anchovy prey and feeding intensity as reflected by the vacuity index, suggesting further investigation of the potential use of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a data as a proxy for anchovy feeding intensity.

abstract = {Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) are a dominant fish in the northern California Current and are important prey for many predators. However, little is known about how anchovy distribution and abundance are affected by oceanographic variability in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We examined the relationship between anchovy abundance and environmental variables at two spatial and temporal scales: mesoscale (surface temperature, salinity, density, chlorophyll a, distance from shore, and depth) and macroscale (Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index, Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation Index, timing of the spring transition to upwelling conditions, and abundance of cold-water zooplankton). Anchovy densities increased significantly from 1999-2004, and decreased significantly from 2005-06 in conjunction with delayed coastal upwelling and decreases in the overall abundance of cold- water zooplankton. Sea surface temperatures and proximity to the shore explained most anchovy abundance and distribution variations. When lagged by one year, a northern copepod biomass anomaly strongly correlated to age-1 anchovy survival, suggesting that copepod abundance may determine year-class strength.},

abstract = {Teleost otoliths are located in the membranous labyrinth and are mainly composed of aragonite and a small amount of organic matrix. Their rhythmic growth may provide important data about age, growth, maturity, and life-history events. This article presents insights into paleoecological and evolutionary details from a study of the otolith microstructure of Trisopterus kasselensis, Trisopterus sculptus, and Pterothrissus umbonatus (Oligo-Miocene, North Sea Basin). Otoliths of Recent Trisopterus minutus were analyzed using the same methods (light and electron microscopy, thin slides) as a basis for comparison with the fossil sample.  Growth structures similar in size and aspect to the seasonal and daily growth increments in living fish indicate both individual age and early life transitions in habitat and life strategy suggesting planktonic larvae and benthic juveniles. The aspect of rhythmic growth patterns is due to lunar periodicity, a common feature in fish otoliths. Moreover, fossil Trisopterus show an phylo genetic increase in otolith-and consequently-somatic growth, indicating a change of life strategy during evolution (Oligocene to Recent). Thus the internal structure of fossil otoliths allows the determination of growth, age composition, and early life history of fossil fish, as well as their direct comparison with living relatives.},

abstract = {We attempted to estimate the survival rates of larval cohorts (3-15 mm in body length) of the Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus population in Hiuchi-nada, Seto Inland Sea, Japan, and examined the relationship to their food availability. The survival rates were directly calculated from the change in larval density during the survey. The estimated daily survival rate ranged between 0 and 89{\%} d(-1), but increased with the increase in the mean concentration of small-sized copepod nauplii ({\textless} 100 mu m in body length) sampled at 10 m depth. When the food concentration was higher than about 5 nauplii L-1, the daily survival rate of larval anchovy reached an asymptote of approximately 89{\%} day(-1). It might be possible to provide a framework for the forecast for larval abundance immediately prior to recruitment size (10-15 mm SL), based on larval abundance of the monitored size (3-8 mm SL) and the survival rate which is estimated from the concentration of small-sized nauplii.},

S., The effect of variable winter severity on size-dependent overwinter mortality caused by acute thermal stress in juvenile red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). – ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fst041. Mortality during winter can impact the population dynamics of fish at temperate latitudes. The red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) supports valuable coastal fisheries throughout its range in the southeastern United States. At the northern edge of its distribution, severe winters may cause considerable overwinter loss and size-selective mortality among juveniles. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments to quantify overwinter survivorship of age 0 fish. To determine thermal tolerance, fish were exposed to various minima (1, 3, or 5°C) for up to 14 d. The effect of winter severity on survivorship was then evaluated by exposing fish to simulated cold-front events of varying frequency and duration. Body size was incorporated as a factor into each set of experiments. Age 0 red drum were intolerant of even brief exposure to temperatures ≤3°C and experienced mortality after prolonged exposure to 5°C. Higher frequency of simulated cold-front events impacted survivorship more than longer-event duration, and recovery time between events improved survivorship. Size-dependent mortality was only evident for fish exposed to mild and moderate winter severity conditions, with larger fish surviving longer. For juvenile red drum, severe winters may cause high mortality independent of body size, whereas size-dependent year-class restructuring may occur during milder winters.},

The shape of anchovy schools were calculated from echograms. The acoustic survey, conducted in May and June 1992, was executed along 7 east-west transect lines ranging from latitude 30 degrees 00' to 35 degrees 45'N. Trawling was made at 5 areas. Over the 5 trawling areas, 97.8{\%} of caught fish were anchovy in the daytime, but the percentage of anchovy decreased to 67.4{\%} at night. Anchovy behaviour differed between day and night. In the daytime anchovy compactly shoaled in midwater or near-bottom layers with the mean packing density of 53.6 g/m(3). The mean vertical height and the mean horizontal width of anchovy schools in the daytime were 3.3 (+/-3.4, S.D.) m and 16.3 (+/-7.7) m, respectively . At night, they were scattered at midwater or surface water layers. The total biomass of anchovy over the survey area was estimated to be 1,960,000 tons using TS kg=-31.4 dB/kg (204,289 km(2)). Some problems inherent with acoustic method for the estimation of the biomass are discussed.},

abstract = {We examined the long-term variability in the abundance of yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata and its relationship with sea water temperature in the Japan Sea, which is one of the most rapidly warming large marine ecosystems in the world ocean. The total catch of yellowtail has ranged from 14,000 to 77,000 t with an increasing trend over the last century. Decadal-scale variability was found for yellowtail with significant shifts occurring around 1911, 1931, 1950, 1973, 1989 and 2000, which was in accordance with sea surface temperatures (SST). In particular, there was close correspondence between water temperature and catch in the Japan Sea: significant and positive correlations between SSTs and catch indicated increasing water temperature in the Tsushima Warm Current region has led to positive effects on migration and recruitment of yellowtail. SST mapping of optimum water temperature for yellowtail habitat indicated a northward extension in distribution and overwintering areas of yellowtail in the Japan Sea during the warm 1990s, suggested that the migration pattern, distribution and overwintering area are largely dictated by SST. Hence, potential impacts of global warming on migration, distribution and fisheries grounds of yellowtail in the Japan Sea were estimated based on the prediction of the IPCC A1B scenario which indicated northward extension in distribution and overwintering region with global warming and will have large impacts on the fisheries for yellowtail.

abstract = {We analyzed the effect that feeding rations have on gonad maturation, mature gonad performance, and the redistribution of the energy taken up by the gonads, muscle, and body fat in captive specimens of Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens). These results help us understand the reproductive processes occurring in the natural environment given changes in the environmental factors such as El Nino and La Nina events, which heavily affect the ecosystem and fisheries in the East Pacific. The specimens required 45 days under optimal feeding conditions (46.1 cal g(-1) fish day(-1)) and at a temperature of 16,5 degrees C to go from an unyolked to a vitellogenic stage. Those females fed 138.3 cal g(-1) fish day(-1) reached maximum vitellogenesis in 30 days. Despite the excessive amount of food, the specimens' muscle mass did not increase. However, greater body fat accumulation and larger vitellogenic ovocytes were observed, indicating augmented energy storage for the female and her offspring. The yolked oocytes from fish fed 46.1 cal g(-1) fish day(-1) became atretic earlier than oocytes from fish fed 138.3 cal g(-1) fish day(-1). Although the food supply was adequate, the females did not spawn during the experiment. In males, food availability also accelerated gonad maturation, but the release of sperm was apparently conditioned by the presence of females with ovocytes in the advanced vitellogenic stage.},

Acoustic data were collected while making parallel transects along which CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) stations were regularly distributed. Anchovy abundance was related to both the sea surface temperature and the stratification of the water column, as classified according to the phi parameter of stability (Simpson, 1981). Regarding the whole water column, the sea temperatures where adult anchovies were recorded ranged from 8.5 to 16.5 degreesC, but anchovy echo traces from waters above 14 degreesC were obtained mainly at night. The sea surface temperature bounds for anchovy distribution were 11 and 17 degreesC, with a preferential range between 12.5 and 16 degreesC, but no absolute value of sea surface temperature was found to be most favourable for the species. The highest fish abundances were related to sharp thermal gradients, either horizontally recorded in frontal zones (approximate to 0.02 degreesC or more per km) or vertically associated to the occurrence of a thermocline (stability {\textgreater} 10 J m(-3)). Sea fronts seemed to be the axes for the distribution of anchovy shoals, and the annual changes in the positions of the fronts seemed to be followed by analogous changes in the locations of the main anchovy concentrations. Within thermally stratified areas and during the daytime, anchovies apparently preferred the thermocline layer or the layer immediately above that, although a few fish shoals were located below the thermocline.},

The periods of the good and bad catch, the year of the biomass peak, and the speed of the biomass decline in the period from 1957 to 1994 were successfully reproduced, except for the biomass increase in the early 1970s. When the model also included with a density-dependent effect, the whole history of the observed catch during 1957-94 was almost perfectly reproduced. These results suggest that the environment in the Kuroshio Extension region, represented by winter-spring SST, is regarded as a leading factor for determining fluctuations of the sardine biomass in the long term, and that the density effect has a secondary contribution.},

Data obteined by Bhattacharya's method were most similar to data determined by otolith analyses. The age-length relation showed that individuals of the same age are larger in the northern than in the southern areas.},

Sand lance (Ammodytes sp.) and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) larvae recruited to the lagoon on flood tide whereas snake prickleback (Lumpenus sagitta) larvae were exported to the Sea of Okhotsk on ebb. Before the ice breakup, ice microalgae made up the bulk of the microalgal biomass in the lagoon. The production and release of ice algae did not trigger the maturation of the late copepodite stages of copepods, and the proportion of adult females in the copepod assemblage remained low. The production of copepod nauplii (the main prey of fish larvae) under the ice was probably insufficient to insure suitable feeding and growth of fish larvae entering the lagoon in winter. Sand lance larvae, the most abundant species to colonize the lagoon in February-March, had to survive for nearly two months at low food abundance. Based on our results, the importance of Saroma-ko Lagoon as a winter nursery area for fish larvae appears negligible.},

A total of 1477 anchovy specimens were collected from January to December 2003 in the Zrmanja River estuary (Novigrad Sea). The analysis was based on the temporal evolution of gonadosomatic index, mass and stage of gonads. The total length of anchovy ranged from 4.5 to 14.5 cm and mass from 0.56 to 19.80 Sex ratio was slightly different from 1:1; the females were insignificantly predominated (male/female = 0.99). The period of reproductive activity was from April to September coinciding with the most developed stages of gonads as well as with the highest gonad weights, and gonadosomatic indices. To estimate the length at maturity, a sub sample of 454 anchovy was taken from May to July (peak of anchovy spawning period). The length at which 50{\%} of anchovy were mature (L-50) was calculated to be 8.2 cm. The length-weight relationship of anchovy was described by the expression: W = 3.51 x 10(-3) L-T(3.211) (r(2) = 0.998). The relationships between total length-standard length and total length-fork length are L-T = 1.1405L(S) + 0.2420 and L-T = 1.0425 L-F + 0.3944, respectively. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were obtained from hydroacoustic surveys, measurement of gonadosomatic index and histological examination of oocyte maturity stage. Sardine shoals were distributed in both the coastal and the Kuroshio regions, but the maturity data showed a difference in spawning activity between the regions. Spawning activity was higher in the Kuroshio region than in the inshore region. Spawning was concentrated within a short period of about 10 d in early March, although detectable in February and March. Sardine shoals did not occur in the Kuroshio region, except in early March. It was suggested that sardine were aggregated in inshore regions before spawning and that most of them moved offshore into the Kuroshio region to spawn and returned inshore after spawning.},

abstract = {This work evaluates the chemical, microbiological and sensory characteristics of vacuum-packed anchovies (Engraulis encrasicholus) processed by different cooking methods under different time/temperature conditions and stored at +2 +/- 1 degrees C. The heat treatments applied in the core of the products were: 5 min at 180 degrees C for fried and 10 min at 170 degrees C for grilled products. According to the results of the sensory analyses, up to day 14 grilled and fried vacuum-packed anchovies were determined as 'acceptable' but on day 21 they were no longer acceptable. Mesophilic counts for anchovies exceeded the maximum level for acceptability for cooked fish after 14 days for grilled and 21 days for fried samples. At day 14, the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) values of grilled anchovies reached the legal limits for consumption (35 mg/100 g for TVB-N). The TVB-N value of fried anchovies reached this limit after 21 days of storage. Therefore, it can be concluded that the treatment by frying at 180 degrees C for 5 min is more effective in ensuring the safety and extending the shelf-life of heat-treated anchovies preserving the microbiological and chemical characteristics. This study establishes the chemical, microbiological and sensory quality of vacuum-packed anchovy and emphasizes the relevance of the quality changes of anchovies heat-treated by different cooking methods.},

The samplings were carried out from October to April in both fishing seasons on board of commercial fishing vessels. A total of 1499 and 1485 individuals were examined during 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 fishing seasons. respectively. Weight- length relationship and von Bertalanffy growth equations were calculated as W = 0.0101 L(2.7948) and L(t) = 16.114 (1 - e(-0.2919) ((t + 2.56262))) and W = 0.0055 L (3.0125) and L(t) = 15.272 (1 - e(-0.284 (t +3.530))) for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 fishing seasons, respectively. Total (Z), natural (M) and fishing mortality rates (F) of 2004-2005 fishing season were calculated as Z = 0.99 year(-1), M = 0.45 year(-1), and F = 0.54 year(-1), respectively. Corresponding rates for 2005-2006 scason. on the other hand, were calculated as Z =1.56 year(-1), M =0.54 year(-1) and F =1.02 year(-1). There were remarkable differences in some growth parameters including weight (9.27 vs. 6.80), length (11.36 vs. 10.05), percentage of fish having a length less than 9 cm (4.39 vs. 34.08), percentage of immature individuals (4 vs. 16) and condition factor (1.02 vs. 0.49) between 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 fishing season, respectively. The changes in these parameters suggested that environmental or biological factors could not be suitable for anchovy especially during the 2005-2006 fishing season. The results of higher natural mortality rate, lower weight. length. and condition factor for the 2005-2006 fishing season and higher catches of bonito during this fishing season (12 times greater than previous season) suggested that bonito, one of the natural enemies of anchovy, could affect anchovy through predation or by preventing anchovy to freely forage in feeding areas (i.e.. anti-predator behavior). In addition to the effect due to presence of bonito, extreme changes in the other biological and physical conditions could have operated together with bonito causing population parameters of anchovy to decline during the 2005-2006 fishing season.},

abstract = {Climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene ice ages produced great changes in species' geographical distribution and abundance, which could be expected to have genetic consequences. Living in the temperate upwelling zones of the northwestern Pacific, Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) might have been affected by these severe climatic oscillations. To investigate the effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on the evolution in Japanese anchovy, fragments of 522bp at the 5' end of mitochondrial DNA control region were sequenced for 241 individuals from 13 localities and 37 individuals of Australian anchovy. Japanese anchovy and Australian anchovy are reciprocally monophyletic and a late Pleistocene transequatorial divergence between the two species was indicated. High levels of haplotype diversity ({\textgreater} 0.99) were found for all samples, indicating a high level of genetic diversity. Analyses of molecular variance and the conventional population statistic F-ST revealed no significant genetic structure throughout the range of Japanese anchovy. Both mismatch distribution analyses and neutrality tests suggested a late Pleistocene population expansion for both Japanese anchovy (79,000-317,000 years ago) and Australian anchovy (45,000-178,000 years ago).

abstract = {Allozyme electrophoresis and morphometric analyses were used to investigate the stock structure of European anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus L.) captured by Italian vessels in the Adriatic Sea. Twenty four putative enzyme loci were studied, al of which exhibited genotypic proportions in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg predictions. Two loci, IDHP-2* (isocitrate dehydrogenase, 1.1.1.42) and G3PDH-2* (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1.1.1.8), showed significant allele-frequency differences among samples. IDHP-2*100 frequencies ranged between 0.35 and 0.88, with lower frequencies recorded in northern waters and areas close to the Italian coastline, while G3PDH-2*100 frequencies followed a similar, if less distinct, pattern. For both loci, the trends observed were spatially stable over a 2 yr sampling period. A putative stock-boundary was superimposed onto a map of IDHP-2*100 frequencies, and a bootstrapped dendrogram confirmed the genetic separation of the two putative stocks, one located around the north-western Adriatic and the other in the central-southern region. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) of morphometric data collected using a ''truss network'' indicated that the two putative stocks were morphologically distinct; 89.6 and 88.3{\%} of north-western and central-southern anchovies, respectively, were correctly assigned by discriminant-function analysis. This variation may be related to the presence of two anchovy colour phenotypes, silver and blue, in the Adriatic Sea. Silver anchovies are characteristic of northern areas, while the larger blue fish are found mainly in the deeper southern waters. Current assessment models for the fishery are based on the concept of a consistent identity between consecutive catches at single ports, which our data reject. We discuss the possibility of partitioning fishing effort based on the proportions of the two stocks landed at individual ports.},

abstract = {Coral reef fishes typically undergo a pelagic larval phase prior to recruitment to reef habitat. This is potentially risky, but likely to be important in connecting populations and avoiding local crowding. Predation pressures on larvae on and off the reef are likely to differ both in origin and intensity. In this study, we used individual-based models to explore in isolation the effect of elevated levels of larval mortality on the reef in 22 different landscapes. We allowed the movement of highly simplified larvae to evolve through selection and mutation events and tracked emerging strategies over 180 generations. The pressure of increased larval mortality on the reef affected overall population sizes and selected for higher levels of larval movement. However, the evolution of movement was constrained, and self-recruitment back to the reef of origin was prevalent, with levels rarely dropping below 50{\%}. The evolved strategies were highly landscape specific, suggesting that movement in contiguous reefs is more readily evolved than at isolated reefs. Future development of this simulation approach will provide a valuable research tool for exploring important evolutionary, ecological, and management-based questions.},

abstract = {March larval and May juvenile Cape anchovy of the unusually strong 1999/2000 year-class were collected off South Africa. Age estimates were obtained from daily increment counts on otoliths using light microscopy for March larvae (14-70 mm standard length, SL, n = 193, 92{\%} success rate), and scanning electron microscopy for May juveniles (52-110 mm SL, n = 80, 22{\%} success rate). Differences between March and May hatchdate distributions were related to the prevailing temperatures. March larval hatchdate distributions showed slight modes in October/November 1999 and January/February 2000, each a month later than May juvenile hatchdate distributions (September/October and November/December). Thus, mortality rates of larvae hatched after mid-December seem to have been higher. Large areas of warm water (19-26 degrees C sea surface temperature) on the Agulhas Bank, mid-November 1999 to March 2000, indicated conditions conducive to spawning and reduced offshore advection of spawning products. A period of strong upwelling, March to May 2000, is likely to have increased availability of planktonic food for older larvae; also causing offshore dispersal of younger larvae and food patches required by these, possibly leading to starvation mortality of younger larvae during strong upwelling. The critical period thus seemed to be later than at first-feeding.},

Variation in body shape, otolith shape and growth was investigated in samples from the central Aegean and Ionian Seas. Intron length polymorphism from nuclear DNA, and mitochondrial DNA variation was investigated for samples from these basins, as well as northern Adriatic (ADR) and Gulf of Lions (LION). Two lineages (clades) of mtDNA that co-occur in the populations of anchovy throughout the region were compared with respect to growth, body shape, otolith shape, and intron variation, to check for any reproductive isolation within areas between the clades. The two clades were not different in any of the investigated parameters and appear to be completely crossbreeding. There were significant differences among areas with regard to mtDNA clade proportions, nuclear allele frequencies, body shape and otolith shape, indicating that several reproductively isolated populations of anchovy exists in the northern Mediterranean. There was an overall fair to good agreement between population structures inferred from the different classes of markers. The mitotype variation indicated a larger population differentiation than the two nuclear DNA loci, which may be related to the uniparental transmission and the lack of recombination of mtDNA.

abstract = {Two international surveys of anchovy eggs and larvae were carried out in the Black Sea at the beginning of the spawning season in June 1991 and during the main spawning period in July 1992. Horizontal tows demonstrated that the bulk of anchovy eggs acid larvae were distributed in the upper 3-m layer, but in downwelling areas eggs and larvae were found down to 70 m depth. In contrast to earlier studies, vertical hauls obtained during the present investigation contained higher egg numbers in the southern and particularly south-eastern Black Sea than in the north-western region, which is known as the main spawning area of anchovy. Long-term sampling by the Institute of Biology of the Southern Seas, Sevastopol, shows that, in the northern Black Sea, the number of anchovy eggs and larvae found since the mid-1980s is lower than in the early 1960s. The sudden decline of anchovy ichthyoplankton in 1989, coinciding with the outburst of the recently introduced Mnemiopsis sp. (Ctenophora), supports the hypothesis that this gelatinous zooplankton species has played a role in diminishing the Black Sea anchovy fisheries, although the drastic changes in the Black Sea ecosystem (due to pollution, eutrophication, and heavy fishing) have also had an effect.},

abstract = {Fishing data provide, with wide spatio-temporal coverage, inexpensive information about exploited species, but a precondition for their interpretation is a good comprehension of fish and fisher spatial dynamics and interactions. In Peru, anchovy (Engraulis ringens) is exploited by an industrial fleet of about 800 purse-seiners operating all along the coast. Using simultaneous acoustic survey and commercial fishing data for the 1998-2001 time period, we present a preliminary, exploratory, and empirical approach to identify the nature of potential interactions between Peruvian anchovy and fisher behaviour. We show that (i) Peruvian anchovy exhibited a composite spatial strategy for the study period, i.e. a change in biomass was associated with both change in geographical extension and density; (ii) fishing behaviour significantly varied within and among vessels in terms of travel duration, searching duration, and number of fishing sets; and (iii) interactions between fish and fisher behaviours differed according to the spatial scale. At a fish stock scale (the scale of fishing ground selection for fishers), fishing was more efficient with low biomass and high spatial concentration (low stock range and high biomass); at a local fish spatial scale (the scale of searching for a school inside the fishing ground), fishing performance was favoured by high mean local abundances and low spatial concentration (the way fish is distributed inside its stock range); finally, at the school scale (the scale of the fishing set), both high abundance and high spatial concentration were favourable to fishing success.

Eggs, small larvae and large juveniles were mainly distributed over the shelf, whereas large larvae and small juveniles were found mainly off the shelf. Although overall distributions were similar, the 2 yr differed in that there was more of a coastal distribution of individuals in 2004, whereas in 2005 more individuals were found off the shelf. There were no significant differences in the length-weight relationships for individuals found on and off the shelf or between years. The correspondence in circulation patterns and the lack of difference in the length-weight relationships suggest that a single population is present, larvae drifting off the shelf due to currents and returning as mobile juveniles. Quantile regression analysis of the long-term recruitment index suggests that transport off the shelf may favour good recruitments. This would suggest that in non-upwelling regions the retention area resulting in good recruitment may not be restricted to the shelf.},

abstract = {The temporal relationship between growth history, sex-specific growth divergence and sex change was investigated in the haremic sandperch Parapercis snyderi using otolith microstructure and gonad histology. Parapercis synderi was found to display rapid near-linear growth with a maximum longevity of 303 days. All individuals matured first as female and later changed sex to become male (monandric protogynous hermaphroditism). Individual age-based growth histories obtained from otolith increment widths illustrated that males were larger than females at any given age. Males were found to diverge from the female growth trajectory during two ontogenetic periods; during the larval period and during the period that sex change took place. In addition, male otoliths contained a discontinuity, or `check mark', associated with the rapid increase in otolith growth during the sex-change period. This microstructural feature was absent from all female otoliths. Accelerated growth in male otoliths lasted up to 25 days, following check-mark formation, after which time otolith growth returned to the pre-check-mark rate. Given the isometric relationship between otolith and somatic growth in P. synderi, and the temporal relationship between the time of check-mark formation and gonad condition, these results strongly suggest that individuals accelerate somatic growth during sex change to become the largest members of the population. Moreover, evidence suggests that the factors that determine the initial growth of larvae influence which individuals will later become males and achieve the highest reproductive success.

abstract = {Cape anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus spawners in the southern Benguela showed an eastward shift in their distribution on the Agulhas Bank that occurred abruptly in 1996 and has since persisted. We assessed whether this shift was environmentally mediated by examining sea surface temperature data from different regions of the Agulhas Bank, which showed that in 1996 the inner shelf of the Agulhas Bank to the east of Cape Agulhas abruptly became 0.5 degrees C colder than in previous years and has since remained that way. In addition, signals, coherent with the 1996 shift recorded in sea surface temperatures, were also found in atmospheric surface pressure and zonal wind data for that region; interannual coastal SST variability is also shown to be correlated with zonal wind-stress forcing. As a result, increased wind-induced coastal upwelling east of Cape Agulhas is proposed as the main driver of the observed cooling in the coastal region. The synchrony between the environmental and biological signals suggests that the eastward shift in anchovy spawner distribution was environmentally mediated and arose from a change in environmental forcing that altered the relative favourability for spawning between regions to the west and east of Cape Agulhas. The results highlight how a relatively minor change in environmental conditions can lead to a drastic spatial reorganisation of the life history of one species in an ecosystem.},

abstract = {The present study furnishes conclusive evidence for the existence of latitudinal differences in the duration of anchovy spawning related to temperature cycle and hydrographic features; 2 main spawning areas were found, one off northern and another off southern Catalonia (NW Mediterranean, NE Spain). Total egg production was similar in the 2 spawning areas and even somewhat higher in the northern area, where the spawning cycle was shorter (ca 2 mo). The areas of highest egg abundance were located relatively far offshore, between 10 and 30 miles from the coast, spanning a very broad range of bottom depths, from 50 to 1000 m. The presence of a shelf-slope front of variable intensity running along the entire coast (Font et al. 1988) suggests that anchovy take advantage of the productivity associated with the front for reproductive purposes, particularly since the front is the most important enrichment phenomenon in the region during summer, the time of maximum spawning (Estrada {\&} Margalef 1988). In addition, the distribution of spawning activity brings to light its association with the zones of influence of the outflows of 2 large rivers, the Rhone and the Ebro. On the whole, the reproductive behaviour of Engraulis encrasicolus in the Northwestern Mediterranean takes advantage of the most favourable conditions to ensure the success of early life stages in a region in which enrichment phenomena are more limited than those described for other clupeoid species.},

abstract = {The daily mortality rates of North Sea herring early-stage larvae are found to vary over decades. Larval abundance data were used with a spatio-temporal oceanographic model to reconstruct temperature histories of the observed larvae. The histories were used in conjunction with a temperature-based growth model to estimate larval age. Mean daily mortality rates were then estimated for the four spawning components (Downs, Banks, Buchan and Orkney/Shetland) using the vertical life table approach, which considers instantaneous abundances across all ages rather than following distinct cohorts. All spawning components, but especially Downs (in the south), exhibited a steady rise in mortality associated with increasing population size. In addition, the three northern components shared a distinct trend in mortality that was significantly correlated with ambient water temperatures experienced by the larvae during the respective time periods after hatching. This trend was also significantly negatively correlated with the residuals of the whole stock-recruitment relationship. These findings were generally robust to assumptions about growth and hatch length of larvae. The compensatory increase in productivity in the late 1980s and poor recruitment since 2000 coincide with changes in the mortality of larvae younger than 30 days post hatch and covary with larval density and temperature. Thus we suggest that the mortality of early-stage larvae does impact on the population dynamics in North Sea herring in its current productivity regime, implying a critical period in the determination of year class strength.},

abstract = {Egg size is a critical life-history trait in which maternal investment is optimized to maximize maternal fitness. The adaptive significance of variable egg size among spawning groups of Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) landlocked in the Lake Biwa system was examined through field investigations and rearing experiments. Observed egg size variations were explained by the water temperature around spawning grounds established near the mouths of inlet streams. Two typical streams with different incubation temperatures showed similar maternal body sizes and hatchling sizes, but eggs attached to the stream bed were larger in the colder stream. An experiment that used eggs from a single clutch showed that a smaller hatchling size was obtained with a lower incubation temperature, indicating that the effect of differences in egg size on hatchling size can be canceled out by variations in incubation temperature. In general, larvae that are less than a certain threshold of effective body size are not expected to be assured of early success among conspecifics competing for foods. It is proposed that environments in which the incubation temperature varies favor variability in egg size to ensure that sufficient food is accessible to larvae.},

The main prey items found in the gut were copepods, and the composition of the gut contents changed on a monthly basis. The most important prey items were Calanoida (unidentified) from June to August and in October-November, Oncaea in March, April, and September, and Oithona in December and January. The prey selectivity analysis demonstrated that the selectivity for a particular prey category was not consistent throughout the months. It was considered that late larval anchovy may actually have no preference for a particular prey category. The major size (body width) of the prey items consumed fell within the range of 0.10-0.40 mm throughout almost the whole year. Late larvae tended to select relatively larger prey items from the environment. The relationship between the seasonal variabilities in diet and the fishery catch of anchovy "shirasu" (larvae of anchovy) is also discussed.},

abstract = {Acoustic data from summer echo-surveys in the Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean) were analysed in an effort to better understand the mechanisms related to did l vertical migration and the schooling behaviour of European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in relation to the time of day. Cosine, quadratic and generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to describe the diurnal patterns in the vertical position and the energetic and morphometric characteristics of anchovy schools. The effect of environmental variables on a suite of school descriptors was additionally examined using GAMs. Disruption of schooling at night was followed by school formation just before dawn at shallow layers, usually above the base of thermocline. Schools moved to deeper depths, close to the seabed during daytime and returned close to the surface to disperse after dusk. Surface light intensity and bottom depth explained a significant amount of variability in the vertical position of schools. Higher light intensities urged schools to deeper depths but maximum downward displacement was constrained by sea bottom in coastal waters ({\textless} 80 m). Along with positional changes, diurnal patterns in school shape and packing density were also identified. Morphometric and energetic descriptors were mostly influenced by school altitude (distance from bottom), bottom depth and ambient light intensity. They presented high plasticity that could partly be explained in terms of the trade-off between predator avoidance and feeding success. The effect of schooling behaviour and diel vertical migration should be taken into account in pelagic fish bioenergetic models and in acoustic surveys in respect to sampling design and species discrimination.},

The total survey area was 128 700 km2 with recorded spawning areas in gulf and shelf waters of 4898 and 44 618 km2, respectively. High egg densities in the warm, shallow gulf waters were produced by small, young ({\textless} 1 year old) E. australis that spawned relatively small batches of eggs (c. 855) approximately every 3 days. In cooler, deeper shelf waters, where larger, older E. australis are found, lower egg densities occurred despite individuals producing much larger batches of eggs (c. 15 572) approximately every 7 days. In shelf waters, the highest densities were recorded at inshore sampling stations. Spawning appeared to peak between 0000 and 0100 hours. Females were more abundant than males in samples from both gulf and shelf waters with sex ratios of 0.61 and 0.56, respectively. The spawning biomass of E. australis in shelf waters was 101 522 t, whereas the estimate for gulf waters was 25 374 t. Due to the differences in mean size of the spawning females, however, c. 6 x 109 E. australis were present in each region. The results support the hypothesis that variability in habitat conditions may directly influence E. australis reproduction. A large reserve of young fish in the relatively stable gulf environment may increase the resilience of the E. australis population in South Australia to unfavourable interannual changes in offshore environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The planktivorous northern anchovy is a prominent vector of the phycotoxin domoic acid (DA) to organisms at higher trophic levels, including fish-eating seabirds and mammals. Although there are abundant data reporting DA-induced excitotoxic symptoms in higher vertebrates, to date there has been no reported evidence of neurotoxic effects in lower vertebrate vectors such as fish. To explain this apparent lack of toxicity, it has been suggested that DA may not reach the brain in anchovies and/or that fish are not as sensitive neurologically to DA. In the present study, intracoelomic (IC) injection of DA, at doses ranging from 1 to 14 mug DA g-1 total fish weight, resulted in severe neurotoxic symptoms such as spinning, disorientation, inability to school, and mortality, indicating that anchovies are neurologically susceptible and that DA crosses the blood-brain barrier in fish. An ED50 Of 3.2 mug DA g(-1) total body weight was determined via IC injection of DA in 83 anchovies. Comparable intraperitoneal injection studies with mice, rats, and monkeys report similar DA-induced neurotoxic symptoms at doses neat 3.2 mug DA g(-1), suggesting a similar neurologic sensitivity and mechanism of toxicity between anchovies and mammals. DA tissue distribution measurements from freshly collected field-exposed anchovies and orally gavaged anchovies indicate that DA uptake from the gastrointestinal tract does occur. Levels as high as 1,175 mug DA g(-1) were measured in anchovy viscera, while muscle and brain tissue DA levels were 3 orders of magnitude lower, indicating low but measurable DA uptake. Further evidence is needed to confirm that uptake is sufficient during field events to induce symptoms in anchovies. Our work provides the first reported evidence of neurotoxic symptoms in fish and suggests that anchovies may be affected by DA during toxic diatom blooms. If sufficient uptake occurs, DA-induced neurotoxic symptoms and mortality may make fish easier prey targets, thereby selecting for the highest toxin levels transferred, as well as providing a possible pathway for the transfer of DA to benthic communities.},

abstract = {Feeding behaviour of adult European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) was studied in the Gulf of Lions (northwestern Mediterranean Sea) in relation to major abiotic and biotic factors. Observations were made during the main spawning period (summer) for two years, data were collected through hydrological pro-tiling, zooplankton hauls and fish trawling performed in areas of high anchovy density. Temperature, salinity and zooplankton biomass were stratified in the study areas, with cladocerans numerous above the thermocline whereas copepods were dominant below. Engraulis encrasicolus was strictly zooplanctivorous during the main spawning season with copepod and crustacean larvae dominating in stomach contents.

abstract = {The coastal ocean off south-western Australia is characterised by the southward-flowing Leeuwin Current, which suppresses the upwelling typically associated with other eastern boundary currents in the southern hemisphere. This results in a unique environment for the transport and survival of planktonic fish larvae. The horizontal and vertical structure of larval fish assemblages off south-western Australia was investigated during winter (August 2003) and summer (January 2004), and related to these unusual regional oceanographic and biological processes. Larval fish were sampled along a four station transect running from the inner continental shelf to offshore waters, using depth-integrated bongo net tows and depth-stratified EZ net tows. The distribution of taxa across the shelf and offshore was strongly influenced by the current regime at the time of sampling. Larval fish assemblage structure reflected the distinctive oceanographic conditions found during each season, and vertical depth distributions of larvae affected their horizontal location. Continental shelf samples were dominated by larvae of pelagic fishes, such as clupeiform species (e.g. Sardinops sagax), whereas offshore assemblages were characterised by larvae of oceanic families, such as Myctophidae and Phosichthyidae. The winter cruise (August 2003) was completed during a time of strong, southerly Leeuwin Current flow, whereas the northward-flowing Capes Current, in combination with surface offshore Ekman transport, predominated during summer. The vertical depth preferences of larvae were particularly influential in affecting their horizontal position; especially so for surface-dwelling larval fishes found during summer. This study represents the first documentation of the vertical structure of ichthyoplankton assemblages in the oligotrophic waters off south-western Australia.},

Larval growth was estimated using the Gompertz growth curve for larvae ranging from 8 to 31 mm body length. The size frequency distribution was converted into age frequency distribution and the daily mortality coefficient was estimated based on larval production rate. The overall daily mortality coefficient of anchovy larvae larger than 12.0 mm SL in this region was 0.064, corresponding to a daily mortality rate of 6.2{\%}. The higher mortality rate of larvae smaller than 12.0 mm was attributed to starvation which may take place in the upper mixed layer during preflexion and flexion stages.},

abstract = {Long-term observations show that fish and plankton populations in the ocean fluctuate in synchrony with large-scale climate patterns, but similar evidence is lacking for estuaries because of shorter observational records. Marine fish and invertebrates have been sampled in San Francisco Bay since 1980 and exhibit large, unexplained population changes including record-high abundances of common species after 1999. Our analysis shows that populations of demersal fish, crabs and shrimp covary with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), both of which reversed signs in 1999. A time series model forced by the atmospheric driver of NPGO accounts for two-thirds of the variability in the first principal component of species abundances, and generalized linear models forced by PDO and NPGO account for most of the annual variability of individual species. We infer that synchronous shifts in climate patterns and community variability in San Francisco Bay are related to changes in oceanic wind forcing that modify coastal currents, upwelling intensity, surface temperature, and their influence on recruitment of marine species that utilize estuaries as nursery habitat. Ecological forecasts of estuarine responses to climate change must therefore consider how altered patterns of atmospheric forcing across ocean basins influence coastal oceanography as well as watershed hydrology.

abstract = {Age, growth, mortality and maturity indices of Acanthurus nigrofuscus were examined as part of a larger study investigating a long-term response of herbivorous reef fish to crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks. The principal objective was to compare otolith growth, mean age and size, growth, mortality, size-at-age, size-at-maturity, and age-at-maturity of A. nigrofuscus between 2 COTS affected (Yankee, Dip) and 2 non-affected reefs (Bowl, Coil). All reefs were exposed, outer shelf reefs in the central section of the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, these demographic parameters were also established at 2 mid-shelf reefs (Grub, Centipede). This species is relatively long-lived with the oldest specimen aged at 25 yr. Mean age al each reef ranged from 5.4 to 9.5 yr, while average size ranged from 16 to 12 cm. Mean size and size-al-age was significantly larger on COTS impacted reefs, evidence which supports the hypothesis of a response to increased food resources. There were also significant differences in size-at-age between reefs within a COTS status. No differences in mortality between reefs was detected, while age-at-maturity was 2 yr at all reefs. Size-at-maturity was 13 to 14 cm on mid-shelf reefs Grub and Yankee, in contrast to 10 or 11 cm on outer shelf reels Yankee, Bowl, Dip and Coil. Importantly, age validation provided 5 response variables (otolith growth, mean age, somatic growth rates, size-at-age, age-at-maturity) which were used to examine the effects of ecological disturbance on the population biology of reef fish. This further illustrates the usefulness of age validation studies for coral reef fish.},

@article{Langerhans2004,
abstract = {Predation is heterogeneously distributed across space and time, and is presumed to represent a major source of evolutionary diversification. In fishes, fast-starts–udden, high-energy swimmingbursts–are often importan tin avoiding capture during a predator strike. Thus, in the presence of predators, we might expect evolution of morphological features that facilitate increased fast-start speed. We tested this hypothesis using populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that differed in level of predation by piscivorous fish. Body morphology of G. affinis males, females, and juveniles diverged in a consistent manner between predatory environments. Fish collected from predator populations exhibited a larger caudal region, smaller head, more elongate body, and a posterior, ventral position of the eye relative to fish from predator-free populations. Divergence in body shape largely matched a priori predictions based on biomechanical principles, and was evident across space (multiple populations) and time (multiple years). We measured maximum burst-swimming speed for male mosquitofish and found that individuals from predator populations produced faster bursts than fish from predator-free populations (about 20{\%} faster). Biomechanical models of fish swimming and intrapopulation morphology-speed correlations suggested that body shape differences were largely responsible for enhanced locomotor performance in fish from predator populations. Morphological differences also persisted in offspring raised in a common laboratory environment, suggesting a heritable component to the observed morphological divergence. Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that divergent selection between predator regimes has produced the observed phenotypic differences among populations of G. affinis. Based on biomechanical principles and recent findings in other species, it appears that the general ecomorphological model described in this paper will apply for many aquatic taxa, and provide insight into the role of predators in shaping the body form of prey organisms.},

Although both species consumed similar types of food (crustacean eggs and nauplii, and copepods), sardine generally consumed significantly smaller prey (modal size-class generally 300 mum) than anchovy (modal size-class generally between 600 and 900 mum). No single explanation can be used to account for these results, and it is suggested that they are the product of differences in gill-raker morphology, feeding behaviour and within-shoal position. These results support previous single species laboratory studies and suggest that competition between the two species in the field may be limited.},

The Gulf Stream and associated warm-core rings are hypothesized as the physical mechanisms responsible for the northward transport of larvae. Specifically, larvae spawned along the southeast U.S. continental shelf are entrained into the Gulf Stream, transported to the northeast, regularly incorporated in warm-core ring streamers, transported across the slope region, and released along the shelf edge north of Cape Hatteras. This proposed transport route was evaluated using hydrographic data and drifter tracks that were collected as part of other studies. Continental shelf water that originated south of Cape Hatteras was found along the edge of the Gulf Stream north of Cape Hatteras, and drifter tracks demonstrated each segment of the proposed transport route. A probability model was then developed to estimate transport times for larvae carried over the proposed transport route using a combination of sea surface temperature images, statistics of drifter transport speeds, and a larval mortality function. Modeled transport time distributions closely matched observed age distributions of larvae, further supporting the hypothesized transport route.},

abstract = {We analyzed the population structure of the Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus), a small pelagic fish, using 6 microsatellite DNA loci. The anchovy is known to have 2 separate spawning populations, one near northeastern Taiwan in the Pacific Ocean and the other near southwestern Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait. The planktonic larvae then drifted north to the feeding grounds in the East China Sea to advance in their life history. Three populations of the anchovy were analyzed, including 2 temporal population from the northeastern spawning ground (I-Lan 1999 and I-Lan 2000) and one population from the southwestern spawning ground (Peng-Hu 2000). The genetic variability of the 6 loci was high for all the populations. The average numbers of alleles per population ranged from 25.5 to 32.3, and the average observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.559 to 0.650. A significant population differentiation was found between geographic populations but not between the temporal populations. However, the level of geographic differentiation was weak, average F-ST 0.0088. The significant geographic population structure indicated that the populations of 2 spawning grounds belonged to separate stocks. Moreover, 16 of the 18 population-locus cases showed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, implying that each spawning population in turn consisted of mixed native stocks. Finally, we posed 3 population models to be evaluated against the genetic data disclosed with the microsatellite markers.},

Time series of recruitment, biomass, local sea surface temperature, and a coastal upwelling index were used to explore relationships during the spawning (July-August) and pre-recruitment (August-December) periods. The 1997-1998 El Nifio caused physical changes in the small pelagic fish habitat off central-south Chile. Anomalous sea surface temperatures (SST) and upwelling indexes began to be detected from May 1997 and persisted into 1998. Recruitment of common sardine showed significantly negative relationship with SST anomalies during the pre-recruitment period, as well as with the upwelling index during the peak of spawning. However, the recruitment of anchovy did not seem to be affected by the environmental changes observed in the 1990s. Instead, the recruitment rate of anchovy showed negative relationship with the recruitment rate of common sardine. We conclude that the conditions of the 1997-1998 El Nino off central-south Chile affected the survival of common sardine offspring, and that the recruitment success of anchovy could be determined by less-abundant cohorts of common sardine through a biological mechanism of interaction.

All fin supports form from cartilage in the following sequence: pectoral, caudal, dorsal, anal, and pelvic fin support. Completion of fins is in a different order. Almost all fin structures are present and partially ossified by the 51st day after hatching (ca. 24-27 mm SL). Caudal fin supports start development in 6.1 mm NL 9 day old larvae with chondrification of hypural 1 below the unflexed notochord. The anterior adult epural develops from two pieces of cartilage. Caudal fin rays develop from middle ones outward. Full complement of principal caudal rays is present in larvae {\textgreater}8.0 mm SL (11-20 days after hatching). Dorsal and anal fin anlagens appear in larvae {\textgreater}6.2 mm SL. The enlarged first dorsal proximal radial originates from one piece of cartilage. A supernumerary dorsal distal radial develops behind the first distal radial. Left and right coraco-scapula cartilages appear first fused ventromedially. Propterygium develops from the pectoral radial plate. The pelvic scute originates from three scale-like pieces accounting for the lateral arms and the basal plate. Ossification of centra begins from 12.2 mm SL. Neural and haemal arches begin chondrification by 7.3 mm SL. Twelve or 11 predorsal bones start to chondrify posteriad by 15.8 mm SL in larvae 21 days old. Twenty four pairs of pleural ribs develop partially of cartilage and dermal origin. Comparisons with other clupeiform species stress the necessity of further research in this fish group.},

During the sampling periods, the anchovy eggs occurred from May to October and about 95{\%} of total egg abundance occurred in only two months from July to August, suggesting that the main spawning season of anchovies is confirmed in summer from July and August in Jeju Strait. The spawning area of anchovies gradually moved to the southern part of the survey area with time. The predominant anchovy larvae collected in this study were mostly smaller than 16.0 mm TL. Correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis showed that the anchovy egg abundance in the study area depended strongly on the wind conditions, especially less than 10 m/s, and increasing water temperature. Salinity variations also had significant effects on the abundance of anchovy larvae.},

Multivariate analyses performed separately on both sets of morphological data evidenced extreme variability among samples, In the case of morphometric data, a meaningful geographical pattern was entirely lacking. The morphological variation detected appeared to have a predominantly environmental basis. Besides, morphometric and meristic data indicated different levels of interaction between the biology of the species and its environment.

abstract = {Ages, growth and hatch dates of ingressing Brevoortia tyrannus larvae were determined in a 3 year sampling survey at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A. To determine if otolith-aged cohorts had variable relative survival, hatch dates of summer-caught young-of-the-year (YOY) juveniles collected throughout the Chesapeake Bay were compared with hatch dates of ingressing larvae. Modal total length of ingressing larvae was similar among years: 28 mm in 20052006 and 20072008, and 30 mm in 20062007. Ages of ingressing larvae ranged from 9 to 96 days post hatch (dph); mean ages were similar among years, but significantly older in 20062007 (50 dph) than in 20052006 (44 dph) and 20072008 (46 dph). Larval growth rates differed among years. Earliest growth, when larvae were offshore (020 dph), was faster in 20062007 (0.62 mm day-1), than in 20052006 and 20072008 (0.55 mm day-1 in these years). Subsequently, from 30 to 80 dph, growth was slowest in 20062007. Hatch dates of ingressing larvae occurred from September to March and 90{\%} (20072008) to 98{\%} (20062007) had hatched prior to 31 December. In contrast, most surviving YOY juvenile B. tyrannus had hatched in January to February, suggesting selective mortality of early-hatched individuals, apparently during the overwinter, larval to juvenile transition period.},

abstract = {Fishermen have long observed the sudden change of shoaling behaviour of small pelagic fish following a strong wind event. The phenomenon was thereafter confirmed by fisheries scientists using acoustic tools. In this study, we report our observations made with acoustics to measure disorganization of the previously observed spatial distribution and shape of shoals that occurred after a wind event. The measurements were made during a fisheries research cruise in the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic) aimed at determining (1) small pelagic fish species abundance and (2) the individual nutritional state of anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus L.) via evaluation of their RNA/DNA ratio. A spatial fine-scale study was conducted in two of the main breeding areas for anchovy, one located near the plume of a large river (haline stratification) and the other in an open sea location over the continental shelf break (thermal stratification). After a strong wind event, a change of the spatial and bathymetric distribution of the fish community, including anchovy, was observed in the open sea area, whereas no effect was detected in the near shore area. The RNA/DNA ratios determined in anchovy white muscles were quite similar in both areas before the wind event. Afterwards, they remained unchanged near the shore but were significantly reduced in the open sea location. This difference can be explained by the disparity in the strength of the stratification (i.e. haline versus thermal), but a change in the species composition of the fish community may also have played a role.},

abstract = {A study was carried out in June/July 1996 in the River Po outflow in the northern Adriatic to investigate spawning of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and survival of larvae in relation to food availability and wind mixing. Hydrographic- and bongo net sampling was carried out on 2 grid surveys; one after a period of low winds and settled weather, and the other after an intervening period of strong winds, which resulted in a decrease in water column stratification. The spawning areas of anchovy and the larval distributions were associated with the river outflow plume (most clearly on the second survey grid, after the period of higher winds). Potential food particles for anchovy larvae, primarily copepod nauplii and copepodite stages, were also concentrated in the area influenced by the river outflow. Although there was a nearly 50 {\%} reduction in the mean water column abundance of potential food particles between the 2 survey grids, mostly due to a decline in abundance outside the immediate river plume area, there was no significant change in mortality of anchovy larvae between the 2 grids; the exponential decline in numbers of eggs and larvae to 10 mm in length being equivalent to overall mortality rates of 43.2 {\%} d(-1) on the first survey and 44.7 {\%} d(-1) on the second. The resilience of larval survival under potentially less favourable feeding conditions, following the period of wind mixing, was ascribed, in part, to the maintenance of local water column stratification by the superficial low salinity input from the River Po. This stratification in the immediate outflow area was associated with the presence of concentrated layers of potential food particles (typically {\textgreater}50 particles l(-1) and 1.5 to 2.8 times the mean water column abundance) in the upper 10 m of the water column, coincident with peak numbers of anchovy larvae. However, since there was no evidence for lower larval survival in areas, less influenced by the immediate river outflow plume, a simple direct relationship between enhanced water column stability, improved feeding conditions and larval survival was not supported.},

abstract = {This paper establishes the spawning habitat of the Brazilian sardine Sardinella brasiliensis and investigates the spatial variability of egg density and its relation with oceanographic conditions in the shelf of the south-east Brazil Bight (SBB). The spawning habitats of S. brasiliensis have been defined in terms of spatial models of egg density, temperature-salinity plots, quotient (Q) analysis and remote sensing data. Quotient curves (Q(C)) were constructed using the geographic distribution of egg density, temperature and salinity from samples collected during nine survey cruises between 1976 and 1993. The interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variability was determined using principal component analysis on the SST anomalies (SSTA) estimated from remote sensing data over the period between 1985 and 2007. The spatial pattern of egg occurrences in the SBB indicated that the largest concentration occurred between Paranagua and Sao Sebastiao. Spawning habitat expanded and contracted during the years, fluctuating around Paranagua. In January 1978 and January 1993, eggs were found nearly everywhere along the inner shelf of the SBB, while in January 1988 and 1991 spawning had contracted to their southernmost position. The SSTA maps for the spawning periods showed that in the case of habitat expansion (1993 only) anomalies over the SBB were zero or slightly negative, whereas for the contraction period anomalies were all positive. Sardinella brasiliensis is capable of exploring suitable spawning sites provided by the entrainment of the colder and less-saline South Atlantic Central Water onto the shelf by means of both coastal wind-driven (to the north-east of the SBB) and meander-induced (to the south-west of the SBB) upwelling.},

abstract = {Results from depth integrated and vertically stratified plankton sampling in the northwestern Adriatic Sea were used for comparison of gut contents of larvae of European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus with composition and concentration of potential prey in the plankton. Sampling was carried out over a grid of stations both before and after a period of increased wind mixing to investigate changes in food availability and larval feeding success. AU larvae had empty guts soon after dusk, indicating daytime feeding and rapid gut clearance. With increasing larval length there was a greater percentage of specimens with empty guts, despite suitable food being available in the plankton for these larger larvae; this suggests differential gut evacuation during sampling-possibly related to the degree of gut development. Larval diet was principally the various developmental stages of copepods, especially calanoid and cyclopoid nauplii, which were preferentially selected by larvae, whereas selection was against harpacticoid nauplii. Lamellibranch larvae and Peridinium spp. were generally abundant in the plankton, but were only present in the gut contents in any number when the preferred dietary organisms were present in the plankton at low concentrations. The number of food organisms in the gut contents increased with concentration of the preferred food organisms in the plankton up to a Limit of similar to 50 organisms l(-1). Within the upper 18 m of the water column, there was a reduction in the proportion of larvae with food in their guts with increasing depth, irrespective of the vertical profile of food concentration. Following a period of wind mixing the composition of the plankton changed. This was reflected in the diet of anchovy larvae, which altered in parallel. There was also an overall 41{\%} decrease in concentration of the preferred food particles of larvae in the plankton following the period of wind mixing, but larvae were still able to maintain their food intake. These results show that anchovy larvae can successfully adapt their diet to a changing prey field and suggest that in the conditions observed in the northern Adriatic, quite radical changes in the feeding environment were probably insufficient to affect overall larval mortality.},

abstract = {Cannibalism by Engraulis anchoita on their eggs was investigated on the spring spawning ground of the northern population of the species during the 1993-1999 period. Egg distribution was patchy and egg cannibalism was only found in a limited number of fish. The maximum number of eggs found in a single stomach analyzed was 433. This value corresponded to 5.1{\%} of the total number of eggs in the stomach of all fish sampled in 1993. Mean number of anchovy eggs per stomach ranged between 3.9 and 10.0 (mean S.E.: 1.5-5.1) for 1993-1996 and 1.3 (mean S.E.: 0.5) for 1999. Consumption of eggs over a 12-h feeding period represented, on average, 15-33{\%} (mean S.E.: 6.2-20.1) of the total egg mortality within the study area in 1993-1996, but only 2{\%} (mean S.E.: 0.8) in 1999. The mean abundance of copepods in the plankton samples (69,000 copepods/m(2)), especially calanoids, in 1999 was higher than in previous years (6000-53,000 copepods/m(2)). The same pattern was observed with the number of copepods ingested (400 copepods by fish in the 1993-1996 period and 1200 in 1999). Relationship between consumption rate and density of plankton eggs revealed a marked decrease in the egg cannibalism to low egg density values and an increase of that parameter with the increment of the plankton eggs. There was strong evidence of a decrease in egg cannibalism as copepod density increased. Our results indicate that not only intra-specific predation on anchovy eggs was high, but also anchovy egg cannibalism could be an extra source of energy when the principal food (calanoid copepods) is scarce. In areas where cannibalism was intense, that behavior supplied 91{\%} of the daily energy necessary for reproduction. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The degree of match and mismatch in the time of larval production and production of their food has been put forward as an explanation of part of the variability in recruitment to a stock of fish. The magnitude of recruitment is not completely determined until the year-class finally joins the adult stock, and the processes involved probably begin early in the life-history of the fish when both their growth and mortality rates are high. The match/mismatch hypothesis is given in this chapter to cover the subsequent development through larval life up to metamorphosis, and possibly just beyond. The match/mismatch hypothesis has now been extended to the upwelling areas and oceanic divergences equatorward of 40° latitude on the basis that fish in these regions release batches of eggs more frequently when they are well fed and, more generally, that pelagic fish may modify their reproductive strategies such that they can feed and spawn at the same time. A delay in predation is of great importance, particularly when production peaks in early development. This model illustrates the difficulties that occur when growth and mortality are allowed to interact. On the other hand, there are three consequences of the match/mismatch hypothesis that are presented in this chapter. However, the limited conclusion drawn in this chapter is that, investigations of fish larvae should continue to be a part of the study of population dynamics of fishes.},

abstract = {We investigated growth patterns and evidence of growth dependent survival for a population of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua using analysis of their otolith microstructure. Central concentrations of a population of cod larvae and juveniles in the north-eastern North Sea were sampled twice (in April and May 2001), and larval/juvenile growth history from each of the sampling sequences was outlined. Growth rate was estimated by fitting a Laird-Gompertz equation to lengths-at-age, and we found the mean specific growth rate in length at age 20 d was 3.2{\%} d(-1), declining to 1.9{\%} d(-1) at an age of 90 d. Otolith radius and larval standard length were highly correlated, and otolith growth was used as a measure of larval somatic growth. The larvae were divided into 3 groups dependent on their hatch-date, and for each hatch group, the same period of past growth was compared between fish sampled in April and May. A 2-way repeated-measurement ANOVA revealed a significant higher past growth of fish sampled in May in 2 of the 3 hatch-groups, implying a higher mortality of the slow growing larvae. Additionally, otolith size at age differed significantly between the April and May sampling of the oldest larvae. Using the obtained information we illustrate the consequences of being larger at age by nonparametric spline functions. These show up to 10-fold differences in the relative survival probabilities between cod of smallest or largest size at age, suggesting that mortality can be strongly dependent on growth.},

abstract = {Multiple internal and external tagging experiments tested the applicability of five back-calculation models (Biological Intercept, Modified-Fry, Body Proportional Hypothesis, Time-Varying Growth, and an Age-Effects model) as predictors of individual growth trajectories of two marine cleaning gobies, Elacatinus evelynae and E. prochilos, that were raised in aquaria under conditions that resulted in variable growth. Mixed-effect model analyses of longitudinal records of otoliths and somatic growth collected at the individual level revealed that E evelynae and E prochilos produced daily increments on their otoliths for up to two months post-settlement and that the Modified-Fry model provided the most accurate size-at-age estimates despite the presence of age, growth and time-varying growth effects in the dataset. Very large errors in predicted size were produced by the Age-Effects model. The four other back-calculation models all provided slightly biased estimates of back-calculated size-at-age, with the Modified-Fry model providing the least biased estimates. Regardless of bias, both experimental and theoretical evidence indicated that back-calculated size was a better proxy of fish length than otoliths radius. Relationships between fish length and otoliths radius were allometric at the level of individuals, which explained why the Modified-Fry model performed better. However, this allometry was undetectable at the population level. This study represents the first attempt to validate modern back-calculation models using longitudinal data collected and analysed at the individual level. Our results suggest the use of the Modified-Fry model as a conservative approach in routine back-calculations of fish size at age from otoliths. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Engraulis mordax and Sardinops sagax spawn in the highly productive midriff archipelago region of the Gulf of California, where intense tidal mixing produces a sharp thermal front. We analyzed the three-dimensional larval distribution of both species around the front from data obtained in February 2007 with opening-closing nets (505 mu m) in 50 m strata from the surface to 200 m depth. Engraulis mordax preflexion larvae and S. sagax preflexion and flexion larvae were on the warm side of the front in the upper 100 m of the water column, mostly in the {\textgreater} 16 degrees C mixed layer. However, S. sagax preflexion and flexion larvae tended to be absent from the stations of maximum abundance of E. mordax. The geostrophic jet associated with the front functioned as a boundary by hindering larval advection to the cold side. The wide distribution of E. mordax flexion larvae throughout the area (found down to 150 m) resulted from the species spawning in several regions. The spawning areas and the optimal conditions for E. mordax larvae had a wider range than those for S. sagax. Larval three-dimensional distribution in other ecosystems might differ as function of the species spawning interaction and the evolution of the physical system.},

abstract = {Using light and electron microscopy the morphological heterogeneity of the retina in the Black Sea anchovy, Engraulis encrasicholus, was demonstrated. A central horizontal strip in the retina contains vertically oriented rows of alternating cones of two types - along cells with the normal transverse position for photoreceptor membranes in the outer segment and bifid cells with lengthwise positioned membrane disks, unusual in vertebrates, that in principle can permit the animal to discern the direction of polarization. Use of a microspectrophotometer has shown that all photoreceptors in this region contain the same visual pigment with a maximum absorption of 500 nm. The dorsal and ventral regions of the retina are filled by rows of triple cones. A triple cone consists of two symmetrical fibrous components of the usual structure and between these there is a small central cone, the discs of the outer segment of which have the standard orientation-crosswise to the cell axis. Rods and both fibrous components of the triple cone contain P500, the central cone, P475. It is suggested that the central horizontal band of the anchovy retina is intended for the analysis of polarized light and the dorsal and ventral regions control color vision.},

abstract = {We investigated the magnitude of short-term variations in the flux of several species of fish larvae in Conception Bay, Newfoundland, determined the contribution of these fluxes to changes in the abundance of these species, and assessed the factors that may be causing the variations in these fluxes. The net effect of transport ranged from a daily influx of 5.8{\%} to a daily efflux of 6.2{\%} from the population. Short-term variations in transport were associated with variations in wind stress. The contribution of transport to variations in population abundance ranged from 12 to more than 75{\%} of the average daily rate of change in numbers for the different species. The contribution of physical processes to estimated mortality rates is variable and can have a significant impact on the investigation and interpretation of potential biological processes (e.g., predation and starvation) influencing the survival of larval fish. We predicted that the average correction to the instantaneous mortality rate due to advection and diffusion should be proportional to A(-1/2), where A is the area of system under study. This highlights the susceptibility of small systems to estimation error of mortality rates caused by short-term variations in physical forcing.},

Juveniles {\textless}200 mm standard length were caught consistently in the inner, central, and outer sections of the estuary. The density of juveniles was two times higher in the inner estuary during most of the year, consistent with active habitat selection by part of the population. A generalized linear model indicated temperature, sampling time, and the interaction between salinity and temperature were significantly related to density. However, the model explained only 21{\%} of the variance. Gut fullness levels of wild-caught juveniles were highest during the summer, but recent otolith growth rates were not related to temperature. The proportion of individuals feeding successfully indicated that seasonal differences in food availability are more important than spatial variation in prey abundance in driving feeding success. Feeding success of caged fishes was limited, precluding the use of growth rates as indicators of local habitat quality. However, marginal increment widths were reliable indicators of somatic growth at low growth rates over two-week periods. The relatively high growth rates and abundance of small wild-caught juveniles found throughout the estuary indicates that the entire estuary system has the potential for serving as nursery habitat.},

abstract = {Due to their population characteristics and trophodynamic role, small pelagic fishes are excellent bio-indicators of climate-driven changes in marine systems world-wide. We argue that making robust projections of future changes in the productivity and distribution of small pelagics will require a cause-and-effect understanding of historical changes based upon physiological principles. Here, we reviewed the ecophysiology of small pelagic (clupeiform) fishes including a matrix of abiotic and biotic extrinsic factors (e.g., temperature, salinity, light, and prey characteristics) and stage-specific vital rates: (1) adult spawning, (2) survival and development of eggs and yolk sac larvae, and (3) feeding and growth of larvae, post-larvae and juveniles. Emphasis was placed on species inhabiting Northwest Pacific and Northeast Atlantic (European) waters for which summary papers are particularly scarce compared to anchovy and sardine in upwelling systems. Our review revealed that thermal niches (optimal and sub-optimal ranges in temperatures) were species- and stage-specific but that temperature effects only partly explained observed changes in the distribution and/or productivity of populations in the Northwest Pacific and Northeast Atlantic; changes in temperature may be necessary but not sufficient to induce population-level shifts. Prey availability during the late larval and early juvenile period was a common, density-dependent mechanism linked to fluctuations in populations but recruitment mechanisms were system-specific suggesting that generalizations of climate drivers across systems should be avoided. We identified gaps in knowledge regarding basic elements of the growth physiology of each life stage that will require additional field and laboratory study. Avenues of research are recommended that will aid the development of models that provide more robust, physiological-based projections of the population dynamics of these and other small pelagic fish. In our opinion, the continued development of biophysical models that close the life cycle (depict all life stages) offers the best chance of revealing processes causing historical fluctuations on the productivity and distribution of small pelagic fishes and to project future climate-driven impacts. Correctly representing physiological-based mechanisms will increase confidence in the outcomes of models simulating the potential impacts of bottom-up processes, a first step towards evaluating the mixture of factors and processes (e.g. intra-guild dynamics, predation, fisheries exploitation) which interact with climate to affect populations of small pelagic fishes.

abstract = {Morphometric, allozymic, and mitochondrial DNA variability previously indicated that the Mediterranean anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus includes two distinct forms, one of the inshore habitat, and the other one of the open-sea habitat. Here, we showed that the two forms significantly differ by several morphological characters. To test the hypothesis, proposed previously, that the two forms are distinct biological species, we used length-polymorphic, exon-primed intronic PCR markers from the creatine-kinase multigenic family and genetically characterized anchovy samples collected in the northwestern Mediterranean and in the eastern Atlantic. Large genetic differences were found between the two forms (Weir and Cockerham's (theta) over cap = 0.397 to 0.586). In contrast. geographic variation in the open-sea forin at the scale of the eastern Atlantic/northwestern Mediterranean was weak ((theta) over cap= -0.006 to 0.042). This again demonstrated considerable restriction to nuclear gene flow between inshore and open-sea anchovy populations. In addition to previous results from allozymes this confirmed their status as distinct biological species, namely Engraulis albidus sp. nov. and Engraulis encrasicolus L.

abstract = {Large-scale ocean-atmosphere physical dynamics can have profound impacts on the structure and organization of marine ecosystems. These changes have been termed “regime shifts”, and five different episodes have been detected in the North Pacific Ocean, with concurrent changes also occurring in the Bering and Beaufort Seas. Belugas from the Eastern Beaufort Sea (EBS) use the Bering Sea during winter and the Beaufort Sea during summer, yet the potential effects of regime shifts on belugas have not been assessed. We investigated whether body size and survivorship of EBS belugas harvested in the Mackenzie River delta region between 1993 and 2003 have been affected by previous purported regime shifts in the North Pacific. Residuals from the relationship between body length and age were calculated and compared among belugas born between 1932 and 1989. Residual body size was not significantly related to birth year for any regime, nor to the age group individuals belonged to during any regime. The percentage deviation in number of belugas born in any given year that survived to be included in the hunt (survivorship) did not show any significant trend within or between regimes. Accounting for lags of 1–5 years did not reveal any evidence of delayed effects. Furthermore, neither population index was significantly related to changes in major climatic variables that precede regime shifts. Our results suggest that EBS beluga body size and survivorship have not been affected by the major regime shifts of the North Pacific and the adjacent Bering and Beaufort Seas. EBS belugas may have been able to modify their diet without compromising their growth and survivorship. Diet and reproductive analyses over large and small time scales can help understand the mechanisms enabling belugas to avoid significant growth and reproductive effects of past regime shifts.},

abstract = {Seasonal and short-term variability of environmental parameters influence the spawning strategies of fish species. In this study, the spawning strategies and the transport of early stages of the two Cape hake species off South Africa were investigated. Distribution of eggs and larvae of Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis was analysed in order to derive more detailed and species-specific information on spawning season, spawning location, and transport of early stages. Samples were collected during three pilot surveys between January and October 2007 and during an extensive survey in September/October 2008 in the southern Benguela upwelling system off South Africa. Eggs and larvae of M. paradoxus were found in greater numbers than those of M. capensis during all surveys. Highest abundances were found from September to October, indicating one spawning peak for M. paradoxus during late austral winter to spring. The western Agulhas Bank was identified as the primary spawning ground, and smaller spawning events occurred on the West Coast. Larvae of both species were mainly distributed in subsurface waters between 25 and 100 m. More than 50{\%} of all larvae caught had a total length between 3 and 4 mm and size increased significantly with decreasing latitude. Merluccius capensis were found closer inshore than M. paradoxus, indicating that early stages of the two species followed separate drift routes. We assume that this distribution pattern most likely evolved from differences in spawning location and phenology. The spawning strategies of M. paradoxus and M. capensis are well adapted to a time-frame of optimal transport conditions favourable for larval survival in the highly variable environment of the southern Benguela upwelling system, but the peak spawning of the two species is separated in time and space.},

abstract = {The Bay of Biscay anchovy has experienced, since 2001, a succession of low recruitments, resulting in the collapse of the stock in 2005; this has led to successive closures of the fishery. This study investigates the possible impact of different controlling factors [North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic (EA) pattern, turbulence, upwelling, and river flow] upon anchovy recruitment and fishery catches. Fifty-five percent of the recruitment variability of this fishery can be explained by upwelling over the spawning area; this is related, in turn, to the EA pattern. The conceptual understanding of the system proposed for the Bay of Biscay anchovy suggests that negative EA periods are associated with northeasterly wind circulation, which produces weak upwelling over the continental shelf. This pattern results in hydrodynamic stability over the area, leading, probably, to adequate food availability. A positive EA (which extends onwards, from 1998) is associated with southwesterly winds and downwelling over the continental shelf; this leads, probably, to the dispersion of anchovy food and larvae, together with increasing mortality.},

abstract = {Fish population variability and fisheries activities are closely linked to weather and climate dynamics. While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of "unexpected" events-that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic-on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans' ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dynamics of fish species at daily. decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relationships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics. It is concluded with recommendations for collaborative work between climatologists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists to resolve some of the outstanding problems in the development of sustainable fisheries.},

abstract = {We compare various alternative explanations of why embryo development is sometimes slow relative to juvenile and adult development on the basis of the standard Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model and make the comparison with avian altricial versus precocial development. We discuss the role of the energy investment ratio, which combines four different aspects of DEBs: allocation, assimilation, mobilisation and costs for structure. We show how this ratio affects the morphology of growth curves: the ratio of the slopes at start and birth during embryonic growth, as well as the von Bertalanffy time as function of ultimate length during post-embryonic growth. We propose an extension of the standard DEB model that combines a Gompertz (i.e. exponential) start with a von Bertalanffy 'tail' with a smooth transition; a combination that has been applied frequently in fisheries research and here given a mechanistic significance. Implications are that a slow embryonic development is combined with a fast post-metamorphic one and that parameters at metamorphosis depend on feeding history prior to metamorphosis. Identical individuals, in terms of parameter values and amounts of reserve and structure, will become permanently different when they experience different (local) environments, even if they experience identical environments after metamorphosis. This might explain part of the parameter variation amongst individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Consequently, little is known concerning potential interactions among these three species in this region. Based upon parallel cruises conducted in June/July 2005, we compared the larval abundance, size-distributions and biochemical-based condition of these species among 1) nearshore (Wadden Sea) areas and offshore (German Bight) areas that were 2) vertically mixed, 3) frontal zones, or 4) stratified waters. In general terms, larval condition (RNA:DNA) was relatively high at all stations. Although fronts clearly acted to concentrate larvae, larval condition was not necessarily higher. For example 9{\%} of sardines captured at the tidal mixing front were categorised as starving, while no starving larvae were sampled in the stratified water masses. Habitats of sardine and sprat larvae were similar, whereas anchovies were primarily restricted to nearshore areas. This is the first Study examining the potential role of near- and offshore habitats as nursery areas and the extent to which resource (habitat) partitioning exists among the larvae of sprat and newly established anchovy and sardine in the North Sea.},

abstract = {This paper synthesizes published results on the carbon cycle of the equatorial Pacific which accounts for a major fraction of the net exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the oceans. Most of the CO2 evasion takes place in the upwelling-influenced region in the eastern Pacific, while atmospheric and sea-surface partial pressures of CO2 are near equilibrium in the warm pool, located to the west. Large changes in the surface area of the upwelling region, which occur as a result of the ENSO (El Ni{\~{n}}o—Southern Oscillation) phenomenon, account for up to 70{\%} of the interannual variability in the net air–sea flux of CO2. On average, the export of biological production, which is approximately the same as new primary production, is similar to that of CO2 evasion (0.8–1.0 Pg C yr−1), but there is less temporal variability due to the very slow uptake of new macronutrients in the equatorial ecosystem. As in other tropical ecosystems, both the warm pool and upwelling areas are characterized by: (i) the dominance of picophytoplankton, and (ii) the steady state, achieved by the balance between predation and growth. In addition to the basic tropical population of nano- and picoplankton, larger phytoplankton are more abundant in the nutrient-replete waters of the upwelling region with the result that biomass, mean organism size and export fluxes are greater than in the nutrient-depleted waters of the warm pool. However, the difference in export flux of carbon between the two regions is rather modest (2–4 fold per unit area) because of the limitation of primary production in the upwelling zone by iron and, possibly, other nutrients. The latter is a typical HNLC (high-nutrient–low-chlorophyll) zone with very low rates of uptake of macronutrients and an essentially constant export flux of carbon due to the ‘biological pump'. This general pattern is temporarily disturbed by the passage of equatorial Kelvin waves and tropical instability waves (TIW) in the upwelling region through horizontal advection and possible inputs of micronutrients from the deeper layers. Finally, low-frequency variations on decadal time scales could influence the values of the CO2 evasion and the ‘biological pump'. Studying their impact will require long-term monitoring.},

The spawning season began on 1 March at 3.8 degrees C and was completed on 3 June at 12.7 degreesC. Mortality among larvae was high in the first 2 weeks of April, probably associated with significant temperature decrease at the beginning of the spawning season. The growth of 10-48 mm L(S) herring was linear, highest for larvae and juveniles from the first cohort (0.58 mm mm(-1) day(-1)), slower for the second cohort (0.55 mm mm(-1) day(-1)) and the slowest for the third cohort (0.5 mm mm day(-1)). Temperature effects on the growth were inconclusive and potentially unfavourable feeding conditions in June might have been responsible for the relatively slow growth of third cohort larvae and juveniles. Relationships between otolith size (perimeter, length, width, area, and weight) and fish size (L(S)) differed among the three cohorts, related mostly to the positive temperature effect on otolith growth, individuals growing in warmer water had larger otoliths. Although a negative growth rate effect was observed as well, it was less significant. (C) 2001 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Abundances of many coastal species off southern California have undergone dramatic declines over the past two decades concurrent with a regional climate shift. This shift in climatic conditions represents a natural, large-scale perturbation and provides an opportunity to understand whether and how various components of coastal ecosystems respond. We conducted time-series analyses on long-term data sets of non-exploited fish populations from the Southern California Bight to describe their temporal trends and explore the timing and magnitude of change. The species examined were classified as to trophic level, mode of reproduction, extent of geographic range, association with benthic or pelagic food webs, and habitat. In general, the magnitude of decline was similar for all species, regardless of classification. Trends were similar at all locations examined within the Bight, suggesting regional declines in abundances rather than redistribution of individuals. These patterns are consistent with the explanation that a regional decline in productivity associated with the shift to an alternate climatic regime is responsible for regional decline in fish stocks.},

abstract = {An ecosystem model representing the continental shelf and upper slope of the South Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean) is calibrated and fitted to the available time series data from 1978 to 2003. We use a process-oriented model to explore the extent to which changes in marine resources and the ecosystem were driven by trophic interactions, environmental factors and fishing activities. Fishing effort and fishing mortality are used to drive the model, while observed (absolute and relative) biomasses and catches are compared with the predicted results. A reduction in the sum of the squared deviations of the observed and predicted values of the biomass is used as a metric for calibrating and assessing the fit of the model. A posteriori trophodynamic indicators are used to explore the ecosystem's structural and functional changes from 1978 to 2003, and a generalized least squares regression is used to assess the significance of the predicted trends. In general, a high proportion of the variability in the time series data is explained by the main trophic interactions (37-53{\%}), fishing activities (14{\%}), and indirectly by considering the environment (6-16{\%}), as driving factors. The model's predictions match satisfactorily with the yearly data on the biomass for anglerfish, adult hake, demersal sharks, anchovy and mackerel, which show a statistically significant decrease over time, while the biomass of flatfish and seabirds are observed to increase. Catch data show a significant decrease in anglerfish, demersal sharks, anchovy and sardine, while there is an increase in red mullet, flatfish, juvenile hake and horse mackerel. These changes in biomass are predicted to have direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem mediated by the trophic web, such as the proliferation of non-commercial species with lower trophic levels (e.g., benthic invertebrates) or higher turnover rates (e.g., cephalopods and benthopelagic fish). This is consistent with anecdotal information from the Mediterranean and is likely caused by trophic cascades due to the removal of demersal and pelagic higher trophic level organisms (predator release), and a decrease in small pelagic fish (competitor release). Trophodynamic indicators suggest a degradation pattern over time: both the mean trophic level of the community (mTL(co), excluding primary producers and detritus) and a modified version of Kempton's index of biodiversity decrease with time, while the total flow to detritus and the loss of production due to fishing increase from 1978 to 2003. Additionally, the demersal/pelagic ratio increases due to an overall decrease in the abundance of small pelagic fish in the ecosystem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The presence of a surface layer of a less saline water of continental influence (CIW) along the continental slope off the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean) was observed in June 1995. This CIW was formed in the Gulf of Lions from Rhone runoff and carried by the current associated with the shelf-slope front. This study analyses the spatio-temporal behaviour of that water of continental influence in relation to the shelf-slope front, and its effect on the distribution of fish larvae, in particular the larvae of the anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus. Displacements of the front are observed to follow an oscillation with a period of eight days and an amplitude of 10 km. Anchovy larvae were associated with the presence of CIW, whereas the oceanic species Hygophum benoiti appeared in the region of the slope when the front, and the associated CAV layer, moved close inshore during its oscillation. The size frequency distribution for the anchovy larvae trapped within the CIW suggests that the larvae had been spawned further north, near the Gulf of Lions. It is concluded not only that larvae were transported by the current but also that their development had taken place entirely inside the CIW. The possible benefit to the survival of anchovy larvae of being kept inside that water, though they have been carried far from their spawning areas, is discussed in the basis of fluorescence and microzooplankton data.},

abstract = {The otolith size - fish size relationship was examined in field-collected larval and pelagic juvenile bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix. The purpose was to evaluate the central assumption of proportional back-calculation techniques, namely that otolith and somatic growth are in constant proportion. Age-independent variability was found between otolith size and fish size that differed between ontogenetic stages. Stage-specific growth rate effects were also identified. Finally, the otolith size - fish size relationship changed at certain ontogenetic stage transitions. These effects, as well as others that have been found, are discussed with regard to the assumption of constant proportionality between otolith growth and fish growth. In light of this discussion, the overall validity of constant proportionality becomes suspect when applied to the early life history stages of fishes. Future work should take a longitudinal approach to the analysis of the relationship between otolith growth and somatic growth. In addition, regression and proportional methods should be modified to account for growth rate and ontogenetic effects. Finally, a relative size approach is presented that is appropriate in situations that require only relative measures of fish size. This relative size approach has several benefits and these are discussed in relation to other back-calculation procedures.},

The settlement season was from June io November, with settlement occurring in two phases over this period. Somatic growth rates ranged from {\textless}0 . 1 to 0 . 25 mm day(-1) depending on age and time of year, making size (SL) a relatively poor indicator of age. Alternatively, otolith size (OL) was strongly related to age, but the linear relationships varied systematically among sampling occasions. Because of variation in somatic growth rates, the SL-OL relationships were relatively poor. The biological intercept method was used to back-calculate fish sizes from otolith increment widths for three samples of fish. These growth trajectories differed considerably, two being logistic in shape and the third being an exponential relationship. Presettlement durations increased from 80 to 130 days between June and September and were inversely related to growth rate. Settlement competence is related more to size than to age. The broad natural variation in early life-history characteristics is likely to relate to water temperature regimes along larval advection pathways through the long settlement season.},

abstract = {The Upper Gulf of California (UGC) is a Biosphere Reserve that despite its extreme environmental conditions (macrotidal inverse estuary) houses a high fish species richness. An intensive sampling of fish larvae and hydrography was carried out during June 2008 in the UGC. From 56 zooplankton sampling stations with a maximum of three sampling strata (each 5 m deep, from 0 to 15 m), a total of 29,505 fish larvae were collected, included in 99 taxa and 32 families. The Bray-Curtis Index defined three main larval fish habitats that varied in composition. (i) The "Mixed" larval habitat was mostly defined in the vertically mixed western sector of the UGC; the coastal pelagic Anchoa spp. presented high abundance in this habitat, associated with demersal species such as Gobulus crescentalis and Scianidae type 1. The lowest diversity and abundance, and the highest salinity, temperature and chlorophyll distinguished this larval habitat. (ii) The "Front" habitat was located mostly on the physical-chemical frontal zone between the UGC and the Northern Gulf; it had the highest specific richness and larval abundance. The dominant species were the coastal pelagics Anchoa spp. and Opisthonema sp. 1; the latter was almost limited to the north by the frontal zone. (iii) The "Shelf' habitat, found over the shelf off the mainland, was the deepest and less salty, and was also dominated by Opisthonema sp. 1, but included epipelagic species such as Scombridae (e.g., Scomber japonicus, Auxis spp., Scomberomerus sierra), probably from the adjacent deeper zone. These larval fish habitats had well-defined limits that coincided with marked environmental gradients, with the lowest larval diversity in the saltiest environment; this suggests that the human-induced shift to hypersaline conditions may have reduced the preferred larval habitat for some species. The habitats most likely change with the seasons, with implications for the management of the reserve. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {On the Spanish Mediterranean continental shelf, late-autumn echo-integration acoustic surveys have been performed annually since the 1990s. The surveys coincide with the recruitment season of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and the start of the spawning season of sardine (Sardina pilchardus), and they provide estimates of stock size for the main fisheries in the area. Latitudinal distribution of the abundance of the two species from 2003 till 2006 is evaluated, and transitive geostatistical techniques applied to estimate the sampling uncertainty of the overall abundance estimate. The anchovy stock was found mainly in areas influenced by river run-off, in well-known anchovy spawning areas, suggesting that anchovy remained on their spawning grounds until late autumn or that survival was higher in these regions of enhanced productivity. By the time of the surveys, sardine were already occupying their spawning grounds over the continental shelf. The precision of the abundance estimates was generally high. The few cases of low precision were re-examined and found to stem most probably from processing errors, so the re-examination has contributed to an improvement in the accuracy of the estimates. The greater precision obtained in the southern subarea suggested a greater homogeneity in the spatial distribution of both species.},

We released these presettlement larvae at night into cages surrounding patch reefs and measured larval survivorship after two nights. This caging experiment involved cages enclosing the natural resident fish fauna, including predators, and others cleared of fish before releasing the larvae. The analyses of variance showed that (1) there was no difference in survivorship between the seven trials, (2) there was a significant difference between cleared and uncleared cages, and (3); there were significant differences between larval species tested. For the seven species that had a significant difference in survivorship between cleared and uncleared cages, average mortality of the larvae was 14{\%} (range 0-26{\%}) in cleared cages and 67{\%} (range 29-76{\%}) in cages with predators. The difference in mortality between species was related to the size of the larvae, as larger species exhibited reduced mortality compared to smaller species. Mortality was related to the abundance of resident fish that could act as predators or competitors. Predation can have a significant impact on the survival of metamorphosing fish larvae on coral reefs.},

abstract = {The spatial extent of small pelagic fish spawning habitat is influenced by environmental factors and by the state of the adult population. In return, the configuration of spawning habitat affects recruitment and therefore the future structure of the adult population. Interannual changes in spatial patterns of spawning reflect variations in adult population structures and their environment. The present study describes the historical changes in the spatial distribution of spawning of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) in the Bay of Biscay during two periods: 1967-72 and 2000-2004. Using data from egg surveys conducted in spring, the spatial distributions of anchovy and sardine eggs are characterized by means of geostatistics. For each survey, a map of probability of egg presence is constructed. The maps are then compared to define (1) recurrent spawning areas, (2) occasional spawning areas and (3) unfavourable spawning areas during each period. Sardine spawning habitat is generally fragmented and appears spatially limited by the presence of cold bottom water. It is confined to coastal or shelf break refuge areas in years of restricted spawning extent. For anchovy, recurrent spawning sites are found in Gironde and Adour estuaries whilst spawning can extend further offshore in years of more intense spawning. For both species, the mean pattern of spawning has changed between 1967-72 and 2000-2004. Noticeably, the spatial distribution of anchovy eggs in spring has expanded northward. This trend possibly results from changes in environmental conditions during the last four decades.},

abstract = {Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data collected during routine monitoring surveys of the distribution and abundance of Japanese sardine larvae (Sardinops melanostictus) off the Pacific coast of Japan in February; 1993 and 1994 were used to construct stationary average flowfields for three levels in the upper 100 m in each year. No large-scale meanders in the path of the Kuroshio Current were present in either year, but the axis of the current was closer to the coast in 1993 than in 1994. The flowfields were used to drive a particle-tracking model representing the dispersal of sardine eggs and larvae. Particles were released in accordance with the observed distribution of eggs, and their positions tracked for up to 40 days. In 1993, the model indicated that approximate to 50{\%} of the egg production was carried north-eastwards out of the survey area into the area of the NW Pacific referred to as the Kuroshio Extension Zone. In contrast, only 5{\%} of the egg production was exported to the Extension Zone in 1994, the remainder being retained in Japanese coastal waters. The consequences of the different dispersal patterns are discussed in relation to subsequent recruitment to the sardine stock. Based on commercial catch data, survival of the 1993 year class was 15{\%} of that for the 1994 class. Hence, the results indicate that export of larvae to the Kuroshio Extension cannot in itself lead to successful recruitment.},

Gradual acidification and increases in the proteolysis index and in total volatile basic nitrogen were observed. At the end of the maturing process, the values reached pH 5.55 +/- 0.03, 21.33 +/- 5.82{\%}, and 44.06 +/- 12.47 mg/100 g, respectively. In the three studied anchovy batches, the biogenic amines tyramine, histamine, putrescine, cadaverine, and agmatine increased during ripening. The highest values were found in the batch where initial microbial load was highest (batch 1), especially for enterobacteria and enterococci. Tyramine was the most abundant amine, reaching values from nondetectable to 90 mg/kg, whereas histamine did not surpass 20 mg/kg. Among the microorganisms isolated, Enterobacter cloacae, Aerococcus viridans, Kocuria varians, and Staphylococcus chromogenes were able to decarboxylate amino acids and produce biogenic amines in vitro. Most (70.59{\%}) of the microorganisms identified were able to produce histamine, 23.53{\%} were able to produce the diamines putrescine and cadaverine, and only 11.76{\%} were able to produce tyramine, although this substance was the major biogenic amine found in anchovy samples.},

Egg abundance was {\textgreater}5 x 10(3) eggs (100 m(3))(-1) in the area off Changjiang River, where a large spawning ground was developed. The vertical distribution of living eggs showed a maximum concentration at the surface (40700 eggs (100 m(3))(-1)) and rapidly decreased to similar to 5000 eggs (100 m(3))(-1) at 14 m. Newly spawned eggs (stage I) were found throughout the water column but were most abundant near surface. Some eggs were morphologically identified as dead owing to their abnormal development and physical damage. In contrast to living eggs, no dead eggs were found at the surface and the concentrations were low to 21 m depth (40-64 eggs (100 m(3))(-1)). The concentration increased markedly with increasing depth, reaching a maximum of 634 eggs (100 m(3))(-1) near the bottom (35 m). Dead eggs accounted for less than 0.3{\%} of the total caught within 7 m of the surface and increased exponentially to 12{\%} near the bottom. The settling loss of dead anchovy eggs also was studied by employing sediment traps at the spawning ground. The downward flux of settling eggs was low (304-405 eggs m(-2) day(-1)) at 15 and 20 m depths, but rapidly increased with increasing depth, reaching a maximum of 1622 eggs m(-2) day(-1) at 35 m (5 m above bottom). By comparing the egg flux at 20 m with the living eggs abundance in the upper 20 m, the settling loss of eggs was calculated as about 0.098 day(-1). This probably represents the natural mortality of anchovy eggs caused by genetic abnormalities and incomplete fertilization.},

Estimates of the daily egg production (P(o)) for the northern stock ranged from 594 to 936 eggs m(-2), whereas the annual means of the Patagonian stock ranged from 185 to 605 eggs m(-2). The mean values estimated for the Argentine anchovy DEPM parameters were characterized by inter-annual differences greater than inter-regional differences with the exception of Po. For the northern population, the estimates Of mean weight of mature females ranged from 15 to 26 g, the relative batch fecundity from 414 to 600 eggs g(-1), the spawning frequency (S) from 0.078 to 0.179, and the females ratio from 0.519 to 0.622 of the spawning stock.

The annual estimates of the spawning biomass for the northern and Patagonian populations ranged between 1.6-3.5 and 0.3-1.5 million metric tons, respectively. A weakness in the application of DEPM was the low precision in the estimation of the daily egg production and the spawning fraction. Alternative methodologies to increase the precision of P(o) and S are discussed. In spite of the high variance of the spawning biomass estimates, the use of DEPM offers valuable information to adjust acoustic estimates and provides time series Of anchovy population size and biological parameters for basic research.},

abstract = {In this study the performance of computational neural networks (CNNs) models to forecast 1-month ahead monthly anchovy catches in the north area of Chile considering only anchovy catches in previous months as inputs to the models was analysed. For that purpose several CNN approaches were implemented and compared: (a) typical autoregressive univariate CNN models; (b) a convolution process of the input variables to the CNN model; (c) recurrent neural networks (Elman model); (d) a hybrid methodology combining CNN and ARIMA models. The results obtained in two different external validation phases showed that CNN having inputs of anchovy catches of the 6 previous months hybridised with ARIMA(2,0,0) provided very accurate estimates of the monthly anchovy catches. For this model, the explained variance in the external validation fluctuated between 84{\%} and 87{\%}, the standard error of prediction (SEP, {\%}) was lower than 31{\%} and mean absolute error (MAE) was around 18,000tonnes. Also, significant results were obtained with recurrent neural networks and seasonal hybrid CNN+ ARIMA models. The strong correlation among estimated and observed anchovy catches in the external validation phases suggests that calibrated models captured the general trend of the historical data and therefore these models can be used to carry out an accuracy forecast in the context of a short-medium term time period.

Larval swim bladders contain gas at night, but not during the day, so the straight cylinder model (no gas in a swim bladder) was used for daytime observations, and the fish bladder resonance model (full gas in a swim bladder) was used for night observations. The sets of acoustic frequencies used were 50 kHz and 200 kHz, which are those used for shirasu commercial fishing, and 38 kHz and 120 kHz, which are those commonly used for acoustic surveys using a quantitative echo sounder system. During daytime, differences in the target strength (TS) of the anchovy larvae between the two frequencies were large (especially between 38 kHz and 120 kHz), but at night, there were few differences between frequencies. These results suggest that acoustic surveys for identifying and estimating the abundance of Japanese anchovy larvae should be performed during the day rather than at night, since this is when differences occur between frequencies and when larvae form dense schools.},

abstract = {Generalized additive models are proposed for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms for anchovy variations in abundance. Environmental variables derived from satellite imagery (surface chlorophyll, sea surface temperature and wind-mixing index), river discharge (Rhone River and Ebre River) and anchovy landings (landings per unit of effort) as proxy for abundance were used, and three fishing zones were defined along the Catalan Coast. A time shift among wind index mixing, sea surface temperature and chlorophyll was observed for these variables to be significantly correlated with anchovy. Results pointed out to processes that appear to greatly influence species abundance and affect different life stages of anchovy (conditions preceding reproduction, larvae growth and survival and recruits growth). A high proportion of anchovy LPUE variability could be explained by environmental variables. Thus, some univariate models explained deviance are more than 50{\%}, even up to around 70{\%} of anchovy variability. In several cases the deviance explained by a given variable was even higher at the longer time-lags. Among all univariate and bivariate models fitted, the model that best explained anchovy LPUE variability, 79{\%} of total deviance, was a model proposed for the central zone, based on the additive effect of surface chlorophyll and Rhone River discharge, considering time lags of 15 and 18 months, respectively, for each variable.},

abstract = {Processes controlling the production of new fish (recruitment) are poorly understood and therefore challenge population ecologists and resource managers. Sprat in the Baltic Sea is no exception: recruitment varies widely between years and is virtually independent of the biomass of mature sprat. Sprat is a key prey and predator species in the Baltic ecosystem and is commercially exploited (1.86 X 10(8) kg/yr since 1974). The population and fishery must therefore be managed sustainably and if necessary accommodate environmental effects on population dynamics. We demonstrate using 45 years of data that recruitment depends on temperature conditions during the months when sprat gonads, eggs, and larvae are developing. We also show that recruitment can be predicted before adults spawn (and fully 15 months earlier than using present technology) by using linkages between recruitment, large-scale climate variability (North Atlantic Oscillation), Baltic Sea ice coverage, and water temperature. These relationships increase our understanding of sprat population dynamics and enable a desirable integration of fisheries ecology and management with climatology and oceanography.},

abstract = {This study extends the geographic coverage of a previous study of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism in European anchovy. Both studies together include 24 samples representing 17 localities extending from the Black Sea, through the Mediterranean Sea to the eastern Atlantic as far south as Dakar, Senegal. Eighty-eight haplotypes define two clades (A and B) separated by 3.2{\%} sequence divergence. Clade A has a star-like genealogy indicative of a recent population expansion. Clade B has a more complex genealogy, consisting of several haplotypes at intermediate frequencies. The distributions of these clades consist of a mosaic with abrupt changes between some areas and gradients between other areas. Clade A predominates the Black and Aegean seas, but is present throughout the Mediterranean. Unexpectedly, new data show that clade A is also at a high frequency in the Atlantic, from Portugal to at least Senegal. Overall, the level of genetic differentiation among populations is high (FST = 0. 148, p {\textless} 0.0001), with the greatest differences between basins. AMOVA reveals four main geographical groups: Atlantic, central Mediterranean, Aegean Sea, and Black Sea. Mismatch distribution clearly indicates historical bottleneck and population expansion for clade A, while for clade B such evidence is equivocal. This difference may reflect a range expansion for both clades, but with higher gene flow (Nm values) between demes for clade A. Both contemporary and historical processes are important in shaping the complex genetic population structure of European anchovy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effects of mortality and gear selectivity on the otolith radius-total length relation (OR-TL), an important component of the back-calculation of length-at-age process, were simulated using a somatic-otolith bioenergetics population model. Four gear selectivities were examined and used to produce fishery-dependent samples for statistical analysis. Samples taken with selective gears produced OR-TLs with significantly different gamma-intercepts than those from an unfished population; significant differences were also found between gear selectivities. The OR-TL gamma-intercept of a non-selectively fished population was found to be systematically influenced downward by total mortality as a result of a decrease in the number of larger fish. This influence was removed using the mean otolith radius-at-age and mean length-at-age in the OR-TL regression, which resulted in more accurate estimates of back-calculated size-at-age; the best estimates were made using only the last annulus in the calculation. The results of this study imply that, rather than a fixed value, the gamma-intercept of the OR-TL and the underlying population growth rate are more accurately considered dynamic parameters that changes as a cohort ages and experiences mortality. Use of the population growth rate and gamma-intercept in the back-calculation of size-at-age needs to account for the degree and selectivity of recent fishing mortality of the population under investigation.

Low salinity Oyashio water and high salinity Kuroshio water merge along the Kuroshio Extension just off the east coast of Japan and together flow eastward. Eastward geostrophic transport and salinity across the Kuroshio strong current indicate that the mixture of the Kuroshio and Oyashio waters along the Kuroshio Extension can produce new NPIW. Transport estimate suggests that the new NPIW bifurcates into the interfrontal zone and into the recirculation of the subtropical gyre. A salinity minimum structure can be also created due to the isopycnal mixing along the Kuroshio Extension between the Oyashio and Kuroshio waters, which have different salinity and vertical velocity structures. The low-salinity Oyashio water seen along the Oyashio branches and the Kuroshio Extension has low potential vorticity (Q = rho(-1)f partial derivative rho/partial derivative z), suggesting that NPIW formation is primarily density driven due to sinking in the Okhotsk Sea.},

abstract = {An evaluation of the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast monthly anchovy (Engraulis ringens) and sardine (Sardinops sagax) catches in northern Chile (18 degrees 21'S-24 degrees S) is presented, using environmental variables, anchovy and sardine CPUE, fishing effort and catches between 1963 and 2007. An analysis of previous data was carried out, consisting of a non-linear cross-correlation analysis to estimate the time lags for each input variable. A multi-layer perceptron architecture model was used, calibrated with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, thus obtaining anchovy landings and sardine CPUE forecast models. An ecosystemic approach was conducted for both models, considering local and global environmental variables, the anthropogenic effect, and the interaction between species as inputs. The variance explained by both models was slightly higher than 82{\%} and the standard error of prediction was lower than 45{\%}. The strong correlation between the estimated and observed series on the anchovy and sardine models suggests that ANN models capture the trend of the historical data. Furthermore, the generalization capacity along with the sensitivity analysis allowed the identification of high-weight variables in the model, as well as the partial interpretation of the statistical functional relationships between the input variables and the abundance.

abstract = {When females anticipate a hazardous environment for their offspring, they can increase offspring survival by producing larger young. Early environmental experience determines egg size in different animal taxa. We predicted that a higher perceived predation risk by juveniles would cause an increase in the sizes of eggs that they produce as adults. To test this, we exposed juveniles of the mouthbrooding cichlid Eretmodus cyanostictus in a split-brood experiment either to cues of a natural predator or to a control situation. After maturation, females that had been confronted with predators produced heavier eggs, whereas clutch size itself was not affected by the treatment. This effect cannot be explained by a differential female body size because the predator treatment did not influence growth trajectories. The observed increase of egg mass is likely to be adaptive, as heavier eggs gave rise to larger young and in fish, juvenile predation risk drops sharply with increasing body size. This study provides the first evidence that predator cues perceived by females early in life positively affect egg mass, suggesting that these cues allow her to predict the predation risk for her offspring.},

abstract = {Retrospective determination of the early life history of fish using the microelemental analysis of their otoliths is dependent upon understanding the factors that affect this elemental composition. Here, juvenile Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) were reared under different treatments of temperature and salinity to determine their impacts on elemental inclusion rates in otoliths. Solution-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) was used to measure 21 isotopes in each otolith: isotopic concentrations ranged over seven orders of magnitude, and differed significantly amongst the temperature-salinity regimes. Univariate analyses identified 13 isotopes that contributed to these multivariate differences; the influence of temperature was stronger than that of salinity. Within each treatment there was a significant relationship between otolith microchemistry and otolith size. To some extent this confounded the interpretation of the between-treatment effect of temperature. In contrast, both the otolith and somatic growth rates were similar between the two salinity treatments, indicating that differences in elemental fingerprints were unambiguously related to the salinity difference, probably a response to the elemental concentrations in the tank water. Overall the study highlighted the current poor understanding of the mechanism of contamination of otoliths by trace elements and their incorporation into the otolith microstructure.},

Anchovy larvae were found widely far offshore. Total lengths (TLs) of the fish ranged mostly from 6 to 40 mm, which corresponded to 5-50 days after their hatching in July. The number of anchovy collected varied with sampling sites, but it was not clear what factors accounted for the variation. While the mean lengths of larvae taken in the Kuroshio Extension area tended to be smaller offshore, those in the transition area significantly increased in size as the distance offshore increased, perhaps because larger larvae migrated northward into the transition region. The mean growth rate of otolith-aged larvae was 0.63 mm per day, which was similar to those previously reported in the coastal waters. The daily mortality coefficient, which was estimated based on age-frequency distribution converted from length-frequency distribution, ranged from 0.362 to 0.136 per day. The mortality rates decreased with growth, being lowest for larger larvae offshore. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

During the survey, samples were also collected over a 24h cycle at a fixed station at position 20 degrees S, 12 degrees 30'E. The survey data indicated that, on average, 80{\%} of the larvae were distributed below the offshore-moving Ekman layer (characteristically 25m deep in the study area). A similar pattern was observed at the 24h station, at which larvae were confined to the upper 40m during the day, but they were more widely distributed down to 60m during the night. There were clear differences between the daytime and night-time proportion of larvae with inflated swimbladders - which ranged between 50{\%} and 100{\%} during the night and between 0{\%} and 60{\%} during the day. The results indicate that larvae are negatively buoyant and sink during the night, even with filled swimbladders.},

abstract = {Zooplankton storage lipids play an important role during reproduction, food scarcity, ontogeny and diapause, as shown by studies in various oceanic regions. While triacylglycerols, the primary storage lipid of terrestrial animals, are found in almost all zooplankton species, wax esters are the dominant storage lipid in many deep-living and polar zooplankton taxa. Phospholipids and diacylglycerol ethers are the unique storage lipids used by polar euphausiids and pteropods, respectively. In zooplankton with large stores of wax esters, triacylglycerols are more rapidly turned over and used for short-term energy needs, while wax esters serve as long-term energy deposits. Zooplankton groups found in polar, westerlies, upwelling and coastal biomes are characterized by accumulation of large lipid stores. In contrast, zooplankton from the trades/tropical biomes is mainly composed of omnivorous species with only small lipid reserves. Diapausing copepods, which enter deep water after feeding on phytoplankton during spring/summer blooms or at the end of upwelling periods, are characterized by large oil sacs filled with wax esters. The thermal expansion and compressibility of wax esters may allow diapausing copepods and other deep-water zooplankton to be neutrally buoyant in cold deep waters, and they can thus avoid spending energy to remain at these depths. Lipid droplets are often noted in zooplankton ovaries, and a portion of these droplets can be transferred to developing oocytes. In addition to lipid droplets, zooplankton eggs have yolks with lipovitellin, a lipoprotein with approximately equal amounts of protein and lipid. The lipovitellin lipid is predominantly phosphatidylcholine, so during reproduction females must convert a portion of their storage lipid into this phospholipid. Developing embryos use their lipovitellin and lipid droplets for energy and materials until feeding begins. The various functions storage lipids serve during the different life history stages of zooplankton are very complex and still not fully understood and hence offer a multitude of fascinating research perspectives.},

abstract = {Shelf waters of southern Australia support the world's only northern boundary current ecosystem. Although there are some indications of intense nitrate enrichment in the eastern Great Australian Bight (GAB) arising from upwelling of the Flinders Current, the biological consequences of these processes are poorly understood. We show that productivity in the eastern GAB is low during winter, but that coastal upwelling at several locations during the austral summer-autumn results in localized increases in surface chlorophyll a concentrations and downstream enhancement of zooplankton biomass. Sardine (Sardinops sagax) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) eggs and larvae are abundant and widely distributed in shelf waters of the eastern and central GAB during summer-autumn, with high densities of sardine eggs and larvae occurring in areas with high zooplankton biomass. Egg densities and distributions support previous evidence suggesting that the spawning biomass of sardine in the waters off South Australia is an order of magnitude higher than elsewhere in southern Australia. Sardine comprised {\textgreater} 50{\%} of the identified prey species of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (SBT, Thunnus maccoyii) collected during this study. Other studies have shown that the lipid content of sardine from the GAB is relatively high during summer and autumn. We suggest that juvenile SBT migrate into the eastern and central GAB during each summer-autumn to access the high densities of lipid-rich sardines that are available in the region during the upwelling period. Levels of primary, secondary and fish production in the eastern GAB during summer-autumn are higher than those recorded in other parts of Australia, and within the lower portion of ranges observed during upwelling events in the productive eastern boundary current systems off California, Peru and southern Africa.},

Elemental concentrations at the center of the otoliths did not differ between locations, although both Mg:Ca and Ba:Ca were significantly higher at the edge of otoliths from the Neuse River than from the Elizabeth River. Three of the elements (Mg:Ca Sr:Ca, and Ba:Ca) showed significant variation across otoliths. Sr:Ca, and to a lesser extent Mg:Ca showed progressive decreases as the fish moved from offshore spawning sites to estuarine nursery areas. The opposite pattern was shown by Ba:Ca. We hypothesize that these patterns were related to the elemental concentrations within oceanic and estuarine water masses. Although both Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca seem to be useful tracers of offshore-inshore migration of estuarine-dependent species, the sensitivity of the technique to more subtle changes in water chemistry remains to be determined.},

abstract = {The anchovies distributed around Japan are only one species of Engraulis japonica Houttuyn although there are eight major species in the genus Engraulis in the world. Japanese anchovy stocks show considerable stability, fluctuating within a narrow range of 3-4 times, 1906-1984. This is in contrast to that of the Japanese sardine which shows fluctuations of up to 400 times. This phenomenon, together with the positive correlation found in abundance between consecutive developmental stages, makes it difficult to explain changes in abundance merely by chance or probability, in other words, by the ''critical period'' concept. The most important factor concerning mechanisms that stabilise stock levels is the population structure. Several local populations of the Japanese anchovy are dispersed geographically over a wide area, each of which is composed of various year classes and seasonal reproduction groups. The existence of these various groupings adapted to diverse environmental conditions maintains the stability of the overall stock. The second major factor is die existence of a population regulation mechanism that changes the reproduction mode and regulates the number of individuals in response to environmental conditions. In the 1950s to 1960s the stock level was maintained by spring spawnings of the large-sized group. Since the end of the 1960s, the condition factor and maturity coefficient of the large-sized group gradually decreased, their spawning activity in spring declined and the abundance of the large-sized group also decreased. The decrease in abundance of the large-sized group appeared to trigger or increase the spawning potential of the small-sized group which spawns in summer-autumn. Biological characteristics of the small-sized group include relatively high spawning frequency and spawning batch fecundity compared with the large-sized group, with shortened longevity. In this way, there are two types of reproduction modes, and the longevity, migration and maturing period of the anchovy change according to the reproduction mode. The Japanese anchovy skillfully adapted to its environment by changing its mode of life and population structure and a population regulation mechanism is working throughout the life of the species.},

abstract = {1. A new laboratory-based growth model for brown trout (Salmo trutta) was used to explore latitudinal variation in growth among natural populations. The model included the effects of differences in ambient temperatures and fish size among populations. Annual growth rates of anadromous brown trout parr from 22 Norwegian populations at 61–70 °N were compared with predictions from the growth model. Published field data from one Spanish, 15 British and four Danish populations at 44–58 °N were included in the analysis to increase the latitudinal range. 2. Among the Norwegian populations, the ratio between observed and predicted growth rates was not significantly different from 1{\textperiodcentered}00 in eight rivers, but was significantly higher in eight, and was significantly lower in six. Observed growth was highest, relative to predicted growth, in the coldest rivers. In Spanish, British and Danish rivers, observed growth did not exceed predicted growth. 3. The ratio between observed and predicted annual growth rate decreased significantly with increasing annual mean temperature. Observed annual growth was higher than predicted growth only in rivers with an annual mean temperature lower than 5{\textperiodcentered}1 °C, and this indicates that some kind of thermal adaptation may occur in trout populations in the coldest rivers. 4. Regression analyses showed that besides the direct effects of temperature and body size predicted by the growth model, annual growth rates were significantly related to annual mean temperature, densities of juvenile salmonids, duration of twilight (average for May–August) and latitude. Adding these variables to the original model increased the explanatory power from 73{\textperiodcentered}9 to 80{\textperiodcentered}6{\%}.},

Ayu were challenged 4 wk after vaccination by an intramuscular injection with live pathogenic F. psychrophilum. Mortalities of fish injected with FKB of F. psychrophilum combined with either adjuvant showed that the adjuvanted vaccines had significantly higher (P{\textless}0.05) potencies than the FKB vaccine alone or sterile distilled water. Moreover, both adjuvanted vaccines produced significantly higher antibody titers than the FKB vaccine without adjuvant. From these investigations it is concluded that the use of Squalene and 763A adjuvants provides enhanced protection against coldwater disease in ayu compared to the use of FKB alone.},

Here is proposed a possible scenario for the recent stock increase based on changing environmental conditions. Based on trends in annual variations in stock and in larval abundances, catches are reviewed and potential spawning areas inferred, assuming that egg masses and hatchlings occur over the continental shelf at temperatures between 15 and 23 degrees C. Changes are then inferred in the spawning areas during 1984-1995, based on GIS data. Since the late 1980s, the autumn and winter spawning areas in the Tsushima Strait and near the Goto Islands appear to have overlapped, and winter spawning sites seem to have expanded over the continental shelf and slope in the East China Sea.

abstract = {Genetic architectures of marine fishes are generally shallow because of the large potential for gene flow in the sea. European anchovy, however, are unusual among small pelagic fishes in showing large differences among sub-basins and in harbouring two mtDNA phylogroups ('A' {\&} 'B'), representing 1.1-1.85 million years of separation. Here the mtDNA RFLP dataset of Magoulas et al. [1996, Mol. Biol. Evol. 13: 178-190] is re-examined to assess population models accounting for this subdivided population structure and to evaluate the zoogeographical origins of the two major phylogroups. Haplotype and nucleotide diversities are highest in the Ionian Sea and lowest in the Aegean and Black seas. However, this gradient is absent when 'A' and 'B' haplotypes are examined separately. Neither the self-sustaining nor the basin population models adequately describe anchovy population behaviour. Tests for neutrality, mismatch and nested clade analyses are concordant in depicting recent expansions of both phylogroups. Unimodel mismatch distributions and haplotype coalescences dating to the last (Eemian) interglacial ('B') and the Weichselian pleniglacial period ('A') indicate separate colonizations of the Mediterranean Basin. Phylogroup 'A' is unlikely to have arisen through continuous long-term isolation in the Black Sea because of climate extremes from displaced subpolar weather systems during the ice ages. Ancestors of both groups appear to have colonized the Mediterranean from the Atlantic in the late Pleistocene. Hence, zoogeographic models of anchovy in the Mediterranean must also include the eastern (and possibly southern) Atlantic.},

abstract = {As more and more data of long-term variability in marine organisms from phytoplankton to predatory fish accumulate, a persistent pattern of the interdecadal and global scale, regime shift, is emerging. Many of the fish populations are growing and declining rhythmically with a high degree of synchrony. A skyrocketing improvement in chum salmon's rate of return to Japan as brought about by a technological innovation is now unacceptable and it seems to embody the regime shift. Abundant evidence in support of the regime shift has been given recently for the variability in climate-ocean system, which suggests that climate change may be the driving force linking the variations in marine populations. There are some forerunning studies that lead to mechanisms causing global concurrence in ocean enrichment. In the traditional population dynamics that has underlain the current stock management regime and enhancement programs, it is assumed that a fish population is in equilibrium with the fishing effort under average environmental conditions. Change in biomass due to environmental variations is regarded as a noise and hence an unfished population remains unchanged. The theory, however, has turned out inconsistent with the real world and it needs be examined.},

In essence, the southeastern (northern) portion of the North Pacific was subject to atmospheric forcing characteristic of that before (after) the major regime shift of 1976-77. Recent major changes in the ecosystems off the west coast of the United States and continued conditions similar to those of the early 1990s in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk are consistent with these SLPA and SSTA patterns. Our result illustrates that a single indicator such as the PDO is incomplete in characterizing North Pacific climate.},

abstract = {In this study, we conducted experiments on wild-caught juvenile gag Mycteroperca microlepis from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to evaluate the effect of food availability on somatic growth and otolith growth. Juveniles were fed at two different food levels until all fish attained similar sizes. We found that food availability significantly affected growth rates. However, we also found that this manifested itself in differential otolith size. That is, slower-growing gag had larger, heavier otoliths than equal-sized faster-growing gag; an experimental result that has been observed previously among various fish species. We wanted to apply these experimental results to field-caught gag because our initial observations indicated that gag from more southern latitudes along Florida's west coast were larger than gag from more northern latitudes, at least during the early juvenile period. Applying these relationships to regional field populations, we found that juvenile gag from the more northern latitudes appeared to grow faster than those from southern latitudes, using an otolith-fish size proxy for growth. However, examination of fish length-age relationships revealed that juvenile gag growth rates were not significantly different between regions. These results are contrary to the expectation that larger-sized gag from southern latitudes are growing faster, and suggests that other factors, such as spawning time and habitat quality may explain regional size differences.

abstract = {Particle-tracking experiments were performed to infer the distribution of larvae of the Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) and to detect effects of transport environment on sardine recruitment, using the output of a high-resolution ocean general circulation model and observed data of sardine spawning grounds during 1978-2004. By the 60th day following spawning, approximately 50{\%} of the larvae had been transported to the Kuroshio Extension (KE). Whereas the spawning period and grounds changed markedly in relation to the stock level, the proportion of larvae transported to the KE remained relatively constant and no significant correlations were found between sardine recruitment and the transport proportion. Instead, the recruitment was found to be correlated with physical parameters including the mixed layer depth and the sea surface temperature along several major transport trajectories of sardine larvae. The correlations were most significant for the trajectories in the region 0.5 degrees south to 1 degrees north of the Kuroshio axis (defined as the location of velocity maxima at each longitude) and for larvae spawned in February and March during the high stock period (1978-94), and for larvae spawned in March and April during the low stock period (1995-2004).},

abstract = {In the last 20 yr, an increasing abundance and northward expansion of Sardinella aurita has been reported in the western Mediterranean. The present study characterizes the spawning habitat of S. aurita at the northern limit of their geographic distribution and determines the hydrodynamic conditions that could control their northward expansion in the western Mediterranean. Data along the Catalan shelf and slope were obtained in 4 oceanographic cruises conducted in the Summers of 2003 and 2004. A clear preference for spawning in coastal areas shallower than 100 m was determined, with larvae showing a wider distribution extending offshore up to the position of the 150 in isobath. The greatest abundance of eggs and larvae was found in the Southern half of the area on the wide shelf near the mouth of the Ebro River. This zone was characterized by high values of surface chlorophyll a in association with relatively low salinity waters from the Ebro River. In the northern part of the area, a thermal front across the shelf, with higher sea surface temperatures on its southern side, marked the northern limit. of egg and larvae distribution, The northern side of this front was under the direct influence of the shelf-slope current, advecting slope waters from the north, while its Southern side was dominated by coastal water. Larvae carried by coastal waters tended to concentrate near the convergence associated with the front. Thus, the thermal front retains and concentrates S. aurita larvae, and could represent. one of the limiting factors for the expansion of the species towards the north.},

C was calculated using an individual-based model, which is an encounter model between copepods and anchovy where the anchovy resulted in a successful capture of the copepod. (g) over cap decreased with increasing anchovy length, but increased with increasing C. No significant relationship was found between (g) over cap and temperature. (G) over cap decreased with increasing temperature, but anchovy weight, on the other hand, increased with increasing C. In the literature, the mechanism of growth determination for larvae of pelagic fish species is considered to be primarily determined by sea temperature and secondarily by food availability. However, (g) over cap and (G) over cap were found to be dependent on C rather than temperature. (G) over cap was dependent on anchovy weight rather than C and temperature. For forecasting the number of days required for development from an arbitrary pre-recruitment size to the recruitment size, we address not only temperature but also food availability and the size effect when considering the mechanism of growth determination for larvae.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for the study of climate on fish populations based on first principles of physiology, ecology, and available observations. Environmental variables and oceanographic features that are relevant to fish and that are likely to be affected by climate change are reviewed. Working hypotheses are derived from the differences in the expected response of different species groups. A review of published data on Northeast Atlantic fish species representing different biogeographic affinities, habitats, and body size lends support to the hypothesis that global warming results in a shift in abundance and distribution (in patterns of occurrence with latitude and depth) of fish species. Pelagic species exhibit clear changes in seasonal migration patterns related to climate-induced changes in zooplankton productivity. Lusitanian species have increased in recent decades (sprat, anchovy, and horse mackerel), especially at the northern limit of their distribution areas, while Boreal species decreased at the southern limit of their distribution range (cod and plaice), but increased at the northern limit (cod). Although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, available evidence suggests climate-related changes in recruitment success to be the key process, stemming from either higher production or survival in the pelagic egg or larval stage, or owing to changes in the quality/ quantity of nursery habitats.},

abstract = {We studied the diet of larval and juvenile Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus in the upper Ariake Bay, Japan. Diet was analyzed by examining the digestive tracts; feeding intensity, proportion of empty guts, and prey selectivity were calculated. Anchovy density was negatively influenced by temperature and positively by salinity and prey density. Diet was dominated by Acartia omorii, which was positively selected with two other copepods, Calanus sinicus and Pseudodiaptomus marinus. In contrast, Oithona davisae was highly dominant in the environment but was absent in anchovy guts; thus, this copepod was negatively selected, with two others, Tortanus derjugini and Sinocalanus sinensis. Overall, larger prey were positively selected and smaller ones were negatively selected; value of electivity index correlated negatively with prey size. Larvae [{\textless} 18 mm of standard length (SL)] showed significantly lower feeding intensities and higher rates of empty guts than juveniles (a parts per thousand yen18 mm SL). In juveniles, feeding intensity increased steadily as the fish grew in size, with a corresponding reduction in empty guts. Feeding intensity correlated positively and empty gut correlated negatively with fish size. We suggest that larger prey are important diets for postlarval Japanese anchovy in Ariake Bay.},

abstract = {1077 isolates from different flora studied during the storage of anchovy in ice and at ambient temperature, were identified and examined for their enzymatic properties in relation to fish spoilage (proteolysis, TMAO reduction and histamine production). The different flora studied were found to reduce TMAO, breakdown anchovy proteins and produce histamine. However, the magnitude of these enzymatic activities was variable according to the nature of the flora. The sulfide-producing flora was proteolitic and reduced TMAO but was not able to influence much the histamine production. The enterobacteria were found to be very active either on histamine and on TMAO. Within the spoilage microflora of anchovy stored in ice and at ambient temperature, Shewanella putrefasciens was active on fish proteins but showed no activity on histidine. Among the enterobacteria, Proteus was predominent and Morganella morganii was very active on histidine. Because of their proteolytic activities, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Acinetobacter and Moraxella might play a certain role in the fish spoilage.},

Using numeric simulations we calculate the maximum sustainable catch (MSC) as well as the optimum level of spawning stock to maintain the MSC. By comparing computed levels with Santojanni et al. estimates, we find that the anchovy population is below the optimum level, i.e. overfished since 1982. We find evidence of overfishing in 1982, 1985, 1986 and 1988. We claim the large catch in 1985 was more responsible for the collapse of anchovy fisheries in 1987 than low recruitment levels. We investigate possible ways of fishing using the two stage model by considering three fishing scenarios: the whole stock is fished with equal effort, only mature individuals are fished, mature and immature individuals are fished with unequal effort. We show that the best strategy is to fish only the spawning stock. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Since post-larval swimbladders contain gas at night but not during the day, the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA), based on the deformed-cylinder model, which assumes there is no gas in the swimbladder, was applied to daytime observations, and the fish-bladder resonance model, which assumes there is gas in the swimbladder, to those taken at night. The two sets of acoustic frequencies employed were 50 and 200 kHz, which are those used for shirasu commercial fishing, and 38 and 120kHz, which are usually employed for acoustic surveys using a quantitative echosounder. During the daytime, differences in shirasu target strengths between the two frequencies were large, especially between 38 and 120 kHz, but at night there was little difference with frequency, suggesting that acoustic surveys for identifying and estimating the abundance of shirasu should be done during daytime, when differences occur between frequencies and the shirasu form dense schools.

abstract = {In ectotherms, lower temperatures in high-latitude environments would theoretically reduce the annual growth rates of individuals. If slower growth and resultant smaller body size reduce fitness, individuals in higher latitudes may evolve compensatory responses. Two alternative models of such latitudinal compensation are possible: Model I: thermal reaction norms for growth rates of high-latitude individuals may be horizontally shifted to a lower range of temperatures, or Model II: reaction norms may be vertically shifted so that high-latitude individuals can grow faster across all temperatures. Model I is expected when annual growth rates in the wild are only a function of environmental temperatures, whereas Model II is expected when individuals in higher latitudes can only grow during a shorter period of a year. A variety of mixed strategies of these two models are also possible, and the magnitude of horizontal versus vertical variation in reaction norms among latitudinal populations will be indicative of the importance of "temperature" versus "seasonality" in the evolution of latitudinal compensation. However, the form of latitudinal compensation may be affected by possible genetic constraints due to the genetic architecture of reaction norms. In this study, we examine the inter- and intrapopulation variations in thermal reaction norms for growth rate of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes. Common-environment experiments revealed that average reaction norms differed primarily in elevation among latitudinal populations in a manner consistent with Model II (adaptation to "seasonality"), suggesting that natural selection in high latitudes prefers individuals that grow faster even within a shorter growing season to individuals that have longer growing seasons by growing at lower temperatures. However, intrapopulation variation in reaction norms was also vertical: some full-sibling families grew faster than others across all temperatures examined. This tendency in intrapopulation genetic variation for thermal reaction norms may have restricted the evolution of latitudinal compensation, irrespective of the underlying selection pressure.},

Growth trajectories (otolith backcalculated mean standard length of 5 day intervals from 5 days after hatch to 24 days) as well as the most recent 5 day mean growth rate of larvae before capture (G(5)) differed among months. Growth trajectories showed the same pattern as G(5). In IA, mean +/- S.D. G(5) ranged from 0.31 +/- 0.04 mm day(-1) (January) to 0.73 +/- 0.06 mm day(-1) (October). In OA, mean +/- S.D. G(5) ranged from 0.36 +/- 0.05 mm day(-1) (January) to 0.79 +/- 0.11 mm day(-1) (August). G(5) values declined from November to January and then started to increase. In general, the seasonal patterns of growth were similar between IA and OA, and a clear seasonal pattern in growth was identified. When the relationships among larval growth rate, sea temperature, zooplankton density and larval density were examined, growth rate was positively related with sea temperature in both areas and not related with the other factors. The similar pattern in growth observed between IA and OA was probably due to the low spatial variability in sea temperature compared to its seasonal variability.

abstract = {The reproductive environment of the South-west Atlantic anchovy, Engraulis anchoita, in the southern Brazilian coast was investigated using maritime weather reports from the US National Climatic Center. These reports were summarized to yield seasonal distributions of sea surface temperature, wind stress and Ekman transport for 2-month segments of the seasonal cycle. The vertical oceanographic structure and dynamics were studied using temperature and salinity data collected from oceanographic cruises. The seasonal distribution and biomass of South-west Atlantic anchovy spawners were estimated by acoustic surveys. Anchoita spawns intensively off southern Brazil during winter and early spring when the Ekman transport is directed onshore, and the combined effects of freshwater run-off and the flow of cold water near the bottom result in a strong vertical stability over the continental shelf. During this season, primary production peaks due to nutrient input from Sub-Antarctic waters and freshwater run-off. These conditions would avoid dispersal of eggs and larvae offshore and favour the production and maintenance of fine scale food particle aggregations required for successful first feeding of newly hatched larvae. In summer, the conditions are almost reversed and anchoita spawners are virtually absent from the area. Thus, the spawning strategy of anchoita in southern Brazil seems to be tuned in a way to optimize larval retention, minimize exposure to turbulent mixing and take advantage of enhanced plankton productivity.},

abstract = {In the 2000 and 2001 springtime periods, mesozooplankton samples were systematically taken during research cruises devoted to the study of the distribution and abundance of small pelagic fishes in the French part of the Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic, continental shelf. Simultaneous activities of three enzymes were measured in these mesozooplankton samples, to characterize the main features of ecosystem function at a regional scale. The aim was to assess assimilation rates of carbohydrates, through pyruvate kinase activity, and protein, through trypsin activity, by the mesozooplankton community and the resulting overall productivity, through aspartate transcarbamylase activity. The highest influence on the pelagic environment was the strong difference in the freshwater outflow rates from the two main large rivers, the Loire and the Gironde, which was principally responsible for the inter-annual fluctuations of the nutrients in the Bay. This overall influence of river flow results in a characteristic pattern of sea-surface salinity, which was reflected by the phytoplankton biomass distribution. Mesozooplankton enzyme activities showed high variations between the two years. The contrast in the dynamics of the pelagic food web processes between the two consecutive years, with higher activity in 2001, affected the nutritional condition of the zooplanktivorous breeding anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus.},

abstract = {We used literature reports to evaluate the hypotheses that: 1. year-class strenght in marine fishes is determined by mortality operating during the pre-juvenile stage of the life history, and 2. recruitment in marine fishes can be regulated by starvation and predation in the egg and larval stages. The available evidence is largely consistent with the first hypothesis, although mortality operating during the juvenile and post-juvenile stage may moderate the variation induced at the pre-juvenile stage. The hypothesis that recruitment can be regulated by starvation during the larval stage was assessed in relation to Hjort's ‘critical period' and Cushing's ‘match-mismatch rs hypotheses. The available evidence does not support a major link between food abundance at the time of first feeding, and recruitment (Hjort's ‘critical period'). The hypothesized relationship between recruitment and the coincidence between the seasonal timing of plankton production and the seasonal abundance of larvae (Cushing's ‘match-mismatch') is generally supported. However, the relationships are weak and the importance of the strength of the coupling between seasonal cycles in plankton and larval abundance appears to be weaker than had previously been surmised. Recent evidence, which suggests that failure to distinguish between food abundance in the environment and the availability of food to individual larvae may have comprimised the evaluation of these hypotheses, is reviewed. The relationship between mortality due to predation and its potential effects on recruitment was evaluated with reference to two emerging paradigms, the ‘bigger is better' and the ‘stage duration' hypotheses. We conclude that failure to fully evaluate the assumptions underlying these hypotheses may have led to erroneous generalizations regarding the importance of size at age/stage and growth rate on the probability of death due to predation. Neither the ‘bigger is better', nor the ‘stage duration' hypotheses is unequivocally supported.},

The same cruise yielded quantitative estimates of two metabolic descriptors of the functioning of mesozooplanktonic communities, the enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK) and trypsin, for the first time evaluated simultaneously. The aim was to appraise quality and quantity of matter assimilated by the mesozooplankton and to specify whether the main components of prey ingested by copepods are principally carbohydrates, through PK activity, or protein, under the action of the digestive endopeptidase trypsin. The larval DNA/C index was significantly correlated with PK specific activity but not with trypsin specific activity in the mesozooplankton. This is consistent with previous data on concomitant variations, although on quite different scales, in mesozooplankton PK activity and the larval DNA/C index. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) showed significant differences in spawning habitat area, spawning habitat quality and availability of survivor habitat as the Pacific Ocean went through the La Nina state in April 2002 to a weak El Nino in April 2003. During another El Nino/Southern Oscillation transition period in 2006-2007 when the El Nino state retreated and the La Nina returned, a similar pattern in spawning habitat quality was seen. The coupling between the atmospheric forcing, the physical ocean states and the properties of the sardine egg spawning are investigated using dynamically consistent data-assimilation fits of the available physical oceanographic observations during these months. Fits were executed using the Regional Ocean Modeling System four-dimensional variational assimilation platform along with adjoint model runs using a passive tracer to deduce source waters for the areas of interest. Analysis using the data-assimilation model runs reveals that unusually strong equatorward wind-forcing drives offshore transport during the La Nina conditions, which extends the spawning habitat for sardine further offshore. A statistical model of sardine spawning habitat shows better habitat quality during the El Nino conditions, which is associated with higher egg densities and corresponded to higher daily egg production. Concentration of eggs is also increased by convergence of water. The results of the source waters analysis using the adjoint data assimilation model support the idea that offshore transport extends the spawning habitat, and show that higher levels of nutrient are brought into the spawning habitat with high concentration of sardine eggs.},

abstract = {We review intrinsic traits of the early life stages of marine fishes to gain a better understanding of how climate-driven changes in abiotic (temperature) and biotic (match mismatch dynamics with prey) factors may differ among taxonomic groups and/or habitats (from low to high latitudes). Intrinsic traits related to the thermal sensitivity of development of endogenously feeding life stages included the time required for eggs to hatch (58 species, 26 families), the size of larvae at hatch (31 spp., 15 families) and the time required for young larvae to deplete energy reserves (48 spp, 22 families). These intrinsic factors will influence spatiotemporal match mismatch dynamics at first feeding, a critical period for growth and survival. In exogenously feeding larvae, key intrinsic traits reviewed included differences in early morphology and developmental trajectories (64 spp, 20 families) and the foraging ability of marine fish larvae. Routine and critical swimming speeds were 5-10 times higher in the larvae of species from low (tropical) versus higher (temperate/polar) latitudes. Based solely on routine metabolic losses (26 spp, 15 families), sevenfold increases in larval foraging requirements were estimated between 5 and 25 degrees C to offset starvation. Finally, a thorough review of larval diets (57 spp, 20 families) found clear differences (particularly at first feeding) by taxon and habitat. Our review and synthesis highlights gaps in knowledge and recommends future research directions to stengthen how larval development, feeding, and growth are depicted within individual-based models, which are useful tools for examining climate-driven processes affecting marine fishes and how intrinsic properties and extrinsic factors interact to influence survival. We argue that thorough, taxonomic and habitat-based comparisons of intrinsic properties of fish larvae are required to adequately project potential impacts of climate change on the distribution and productivity of marine fish species.},

abstract = {The spatio-temporal distribution of the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in its early life stages was related to environmental conditions within the Guadalquivir River estuary (south-west, Spain) by monthly field surveys during nine periods of recruitment (May 1997 to December 2005). Anchovy post-larvae showed a consistent seasonal pattern of abundance throughout the study period: each year, a high anchovy recruitment period (HARP) occurred from late May to November, with a main peak in July, coinciding with the period when environmental conditions were more stable. Results of stepwise multiple regression analysis indicates that density of its main prey, Mesopodopsis slabberi, explained 45{\%} of total anchovy density variance. Furthermore, after removing the effect of this variable, interannual differences in the anchovy estuarine recruitment were not significant. Clear spatial and tidal trends were also observed for both prey and predator: at each sampling date, density decreased from the outer to inner estuary; at each sampling site, density was higher during ebbs than during floods. Field distributions related to environmental gradients during HARP indicated that the populations of E. encrasicolus and M. slabberi seemed to hold a steady position at a point on the salinity gradient by longitudinal displacement within the estuary. Since freshwater management actions affect the longitudinal position of the salinity gradient as well as the input of nutrients to the estuary and adjacent coastal areas, it is hypothesized that this factor may also be relevant to anchovy recruitment.

abstract = {A combined study of Alboran Sea Sardina pilchardus larval daily growth and isotopic signature was carried out to elucidate the cause of morphometric differences observed in a single larval school whereby the standard length (L(S)) v. dry mass (M(D)) relationship differentiated a heavier-by-size larval group from a lighter larval group. The daily growth analysis revealed that this difference originated from two larval growth patterns, where a fast growing population (F) in contrast to a slow-growing larval population (S) was distinguished. The S-growing larval cohort had a significantly higher nitrogen (N) content as a result of greater somatic mass build up with time in the form of structural proteins. Alternatively, the F-growing population showed a significantly greater amount of carbon (C) content with age, indicating faster metabolic rates of C accretion compared to the S-growing group. In consequence, the C:N ratios of the F-growing larvae were significantly higher than the S-group. C:N ratios of both larval populations showed significant linear decrease with age (and size), while K showed an inverse relationship. The stable isotopes of N did not show significant differences between the S and F-growing larvae. In F-growing larvae, however, a significant linear increase in delta(15)N (by age class) was observed, indicating that as larvae undergo ontogenetic development, trophic level tends to increase. This was also made evident by the significant decrease in age of delta(15)N coefficients of variation (by age class). The higher delta(13)C values in the S-growing larvae were related to the lower growth rates observed in this group. These results suggest a broader trophic flexibility in younger larvae, but moving towards a trophic specialization and more selective diets with age. This trophic specialization shows a tendency of a greater prey size with age. These findings suggest that S-growing larvae have a more omnivorous diet than the F-growing ones.

abstract = {We present a composite time series of Pacific sardine and northern anchovy fish-scale-deposition rates developed from the anaerobic varved sediments of the Santa Barbara Basin off Southern California. These series were constructed by integrating and adding to the data sets developed by Soutar and Isaacs and cover the period from A. D. 270 through 1970. We offer these series as a current best estimate of the sardine and anchovy scale-deposition rites and point out the sources and ranges Of uncertainty remaining in the data. This includes providing a detailed analysis to determine the strength of the signal compared to the noise in scale-deposition rates. We also recalibrate the scale-deposition data using available population estimates; we use this recalibration to hindcast the variability in sardine and anchovy stocks through almost 2000 years. Spectral analysis of the scale-deposition series shows that sardines and anchovies both tend to vary over a period of approximately 60 years. In addition, the anchovies fluctuate at a period of 100 years. The anchovy and sardine series show a moderate correlation over long time scales of several centuries or more; the correlation of shorter-period components in the time series is virtually nil. The scale-deposition record shows nine major recoveries and subsequent collapses of the sardine population over 1700 years. The average time for a recovery of the sardine is 30 years. A recovery is defined as an increase from less than one to over four million metric toils of biomass. We find that the current recovery is not unlike those of the past in its rate or magnitude.},

abstract = {The recently launched Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) surveys to estimate the spawning stock biomass (SSB) of the northern Aegean Sea anchovy stock are presented and variability in plankton and adult parameters is analyzed for the yearly applications of 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008. Anchovy spawned mainly over the continental shelf of the Thracian Sea in the east (directly affected by Black Sea waters), and the semi-enclosed Thermaikos Gulf and Evoikos Gulf in the west. The surveyed area was therefore post-stratified into an eastern and western region and DEPM parameters, which, in certain years, differed markedly between the two areas, were estimated separately for the two strata. To increase precision of the daily egg production estimates, both eggs and yolk sac larvae were used assuming that the mortality rate does not change between the egg and yolk sac larval stage. Embryonic mortality increased as a power function of temperature. The estimation of spawning fraction was based on the postovulatory follicles (POFs) method and was particularly complicated due to the presence of strong thermoclines and diel vertical migration of the fish: POF absorption was very fast during the night, when fish were located above the thermocline ({\textgreater}20 degrees C), but relatively slow during the day, when fish were close to the bottom at similar to 14-15 degrees C. Mean relative batch fecundity was significantly related to somatic condition (energy reserves) whereas spawning frequency was related to liver condition (presumably, direct food intake). In comparing daily specific fecundities (DSFs) with concurrent estimates of mesozooplankton biomass and total anchovy biomass (independently derived from acoustic sampling) evidence for strong density-dependence in DSF emerged. Density-dependent use (expansion-contraction) of the spawning habitat (SA), indexed by the ratio CV(SA)/CV(SSB), was relatively low but density-dependency of egg production CV(DSF)/CV(SSB) was particularly high in the N. Aegean Sea compared to the more productive Bay of Biscay or upwelling regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The feeding of Engraulis anchoita was studied in the coastal reproductive habitat of the northern population during the spawning period. Stomach contents of anchovy adults and plankton samples taken during a research cruise were examined. The highest stomach fullness values were found in the Rio de la Plata estuary, particularly at stations close to the surface salinity front. Copepods, particularly those {\textless} 1 mm total length, represented by Paracalanus spp. and Oithona spp., were the most abundant prey. The dominance of small copepods in the Argentine anchovy diet is noted for the first time. Ecological implications of this fact are discussed. Other abundant preys were appendicularians, cladocerans, and fish eggs. The species composition of the zooplankton samples coincided roughly with that found in the stomach contents. However, selective feeding was observed on preys {\textgreater} 1 mm total length. This might be explained by a low gill rakers efficiency of adult anchovies to retain small prey. In the Rio de la Plata front, both the reported large biomasses of zooplankton and the observed intense anchovy feeding revealed the ecological significance of this front, especially when compared with the contiguous "poor in food" coastal areas.},

Measuring egg length (L: mm; major axis of chorion) and width (S: mm; minor axis), egg volume (V: mm(3)) was evaluated by V=pi/6 x L x S-2. The egg lengths and the evaluated volumes of eggs were used as the egg size indexes. The standard length (SL: mm) of the unfed larvae increased during the first three days after hatching and later decreased at 20 degrees C. The SL at the third day (Max, SL) increased with increasing egg size. The correlation of Max. SL was more noticeable with egg length than evaluated egg volume. The survival time of the unfed anchovy larvae also increased with increasing egg size. The correlations between mean survival time and two indexes of egg size were both significant. The feeding potential of the first feeding larvae was assessed by the feeding index (relative volume of rotifers in a gut) and the percentage of feeding success (percentage of larvae with rotifers in a gut). Both indexes increased with increasing egg size, suggesting that larger larvae which are hatched from larger eggs have a higher feeding potential than smaller ones. Larger anchovy larvae from larger eggs have a higher survival potential, and may be advantageous for surviving, especially under poor feeding conditions.},

abstract = {In Carapus homei, reef colonisation is associated with a penetration inside a sea cucumber followed by heavy transformations during which the length of the fish is reduced by 60{\%}. By comparing vertebral axis to otolith ontogenetic changes, this study aimed (i) to specify the events linked to metamorphosis, and (ii) to establish to what extent these fish have the ability to delay it. Different larvae of C. homei were caught when settling on the reef and kept in different experimental conditions for at least 7 days and up to 21 days: darkness or natural light conditions, presence of sea cucumber or not, and food deprivation or not. Whatever the nutritional condition, a period of darkness seems sufficient to initiate metamorphosis. Twenty-one days in natural light conditions delayed metamorphosis, whereas the whole metamorphosis process is the fastest (15 days) for larvae living in sea cucumbers. Whether the metamorphosis was initiated or not, otoliths were modified with the formation of a transition zone, whose structure varied depending on the experimental conditions. At day 21, larvae maintained in darkness had an otolith transition zone with more increments (around 80), albeit wider than those (more or less 21) of individuals kept under natural lighting. These differences in otolith growth could indicate an increased incorporation rate of released metabolites by metamorphosing larvae. However, the presence of a transition zone in delayed-metamorphosis larvae suggests that these otolith changes record the endogenously-induced onset of metamorphosis, whereas body transformations seem to be modulated by the environmental conditions of settlement.

abstract = {Fish larval distributions support the hypothesis that East: Atlantic "upwelling" undercurrents are interconnected, and can entrain plankton from the Equatorial Undercurrents towards temperate latitudes. This conclusion is based on historic and recently collected data on the distribution of adults and larvae of mainly two equatorial, mesopelagic fish species Bathylagus argyrogaster and Hygophum macrochir and consistent with hydrographic data. Along the continental slope these larvae occur 440 to 920 km polewards of the reproductive ranges of their adults. Larval B. argyrogaster occurs mainly below the thermocline and reaches farther polewards than larval H. macrochir, which dwells mainly at thermocline depths. At tropical latitudes the larvae of both species occur frequently, and within a generally poleward flow. Immediately polewards of the Cape Verde Frontal Zone, and Angola-Benguela Frontal Zone, respectively, the larvae become rare and more deeply distributed. At these fronts the poleward flows are thought to submerge below the equatorward flows of the Canary Current and Benguela Current, and to form the slope-undercurrents of the Northwest and Southwest African upwelling systems. Larvae in these undercurrents reach minimum latitudes of 22 degrees N and 23 degrees 30'S. At the poleward flanks of East Atlantic cyclonic gyres, such as the Guinea Dome, Central Mauritanian Gyre, and Angola Dome, retroflections of the poleward current systems occur, also entraining and transporting larvae offshore.},

abstract = {We examined otolith opacity of Baltic cod in relation to environmental conditions in order to evaluate the formation mechanisms of seasonal patterns used in age determination. Adult fish were tagged with data storage tags (DSTs) and a permanent mark was induced in the otoliths by injection of a strontium chloride solution. Based on environmental conditions experienced, fish were classified into different behavioural types: non-reproducing 'non-spawner', and 'spawner' undertaking spawning migrations. Otolith opacity, an indicator of otolith and fish somatic growth and condition, was examined in relation to these environmental drivers. Temperature was the only environmental variable with a significant effect, overlaying a strong size-related effect. The temperature effect was not uniform across behavioural types and spawning periods. Opacity showed a negative correlation with temperature as expected-but in non-spawning fish only. In spawners, the general trend was a decrease in opacity from pre- to post spawning. A significant - but positive - temperature effect was only found in the pre-spawning period. The negative effects during and following spawning were not significant. In spawners, this decoupling leads to an otolith structure with stronger contrasts and more abrupt changes, while in non-spawners, opacity changes more smoothly. The trigger for this decoupling seems to be an interaction between temperature exposure and seasonal variations in food availability and may serve as a tool to identify the occurrence and repetitiveness of spawning in Baltic cod.},

abstract = {Understanding and modelling the vertical distribution of fish eggs in the water column is a major challenge for future use of underway-continuous egg samplers as estimators of the total egg abundance. This study presents modelling of field data of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) egg vertical distribution obtained from LHPR sampling in the Bay of Biscay. Starting from Sundby's model [Deep-Sea Res. 30 ( 1983) 645], improvements were achieved through successive modifications concerning egg buoyancy and vertical propagation of wind-induced turbulence. In addition, measurements of egg settling velocity and buoyancy by stages were included as inputs for the model. The best model fitting was achieved through the adoption of a gradual turbulence vertical decay model ( proportional to the inverse of the water density profile), a Gaussian variability of egg density and adaptability of the egg density to the surrounding water by means of permeability of the chorion. This led to improvements over the Sundby original model. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the modelled egg abundance profiles compared with the observed ones was around 80{\%} for both sardine and anchovy. The model described successfully the vertical distribution of eggs for waters of high surface salinity (R-2 of almost 90{\%}), but less so for waters of low surface salinity (R-2 of about 70{\%}).},

abstract = {The energy density (E(D)) of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in the Bay of Biscay was determined by direct calorimetry and its evolution with size, age and season was investigated. The water content and energy density varied seasonally following opposite trends. The E(D) g(-1) of wet mass (M(W)) was highest at the end of the feeding season (autumn: c. 8 kJ g(-1) M(W)) and lowest in late winter (c. 6 kJ g(-1) M(W)). In winter, the fish lost mass, which was partially replaced by water, and the energy density decreased. These variations in water content and organic matter content may have implications on the buoyancy of the fish. The water content was the major driver of the energy density variations for a M(W) basis. A significant linear relationship was established between E(D) g(-1) (y) and the per cent dry mass (M(D); x): y = -4.937 + 0.411x. In the light of the current literature, this relationship seemed to be not only species specific but also ecosystem specific. Calibration and validation of fish bioenergetics models require energy content measurements on fish samples collected at sea. The present study provides a first reference for the energetics of E. encrasicolus in the Bay of Biscay.},

The Laird-Gompertz growth model was adjusted to the data and instantaneous growth rates were compared for anchovy larvae of other habitats in the SW Atlantic. Larval growth rates for several stocks were shown to be dependent on environmental conditions and the calculated size at first feeding on the temperature, producing geographical variation of larval growth rate throughout the distribution range of the species.

Variables such as body length, body depth at vent and yolk area at hatch have been viewed as critical aspects for larval survival at first feeding and beyond. Incubation temperatures were maintained at 20, 21.6, 23 and 29 degrees C using incubation chambers. Incubation trays were filled with 50 mL of water at salinity concentrations of 10 g/L and 20 g/L. Newly fertilized eggs were placed in the incubation trays and checked daily for the presence of newly hatched larvae. The larvae were collected and analyzed by image analysis software to determine the length, body depth and yolk area of each larva. Larvae incubated in lower temperatures had the longest incubation time but were more developed with the least amount of yolk. Conversely, larvae incubated in the highest temperature had the shortest incubation time but were less developed with the greater relative amounts of yolk. Larvae from the 20 g/L salinity trial had a longer mean time to hatch and total length compared to the 10 g/L trial. The results of this study may be used in estimating developmental responses to temperature and salinity. Coordination of hatch times and morphometric traits can be managed through the manipulation of temperature and salinity to achieve desired parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Dispersal of fish early life stages explains part of the recruitment success, through interannual variability in spawning, transport and survival. Dispersal results from a complex interaction between physical and biological processes acting at different temporal and spatial scales, and at the individual or population level. In this paper we quantify the response of anchovy egg and larval dispersal in the Bay of Biscay to the following sources of variability: vertical larval behaviour, drift duration, adult spawning location and timing, and spatio-temporal variability in the hydrodynamics. We use simulations of Lagrangian trajectories in a 3-dimensional hydrodynamic model, as well as spatial indices describing different properties of the dispersal kernel: the mean transport (distance, direction), its variance, occupation of space by particles and their aggregation. We show that larval drift duration has a major impact on the dispersion at scales of similar to 100 km, but that vertical behaviour becomes dominant reducing dispersion at scales of similar to 1-10 km. Spawning location plays a major role in explaining connectivity patterns, in conjunction with spawning temporal variability. Interannual variability in the circulation dominates over seasonal variability. However, seasonal patterns become predominant for coastal spawning locations, revealing a recurrent shift in the direction of dispersal during the anchovy spawning season. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigated the geographical origin and migration of anchovy Engraulis japonicus in Tachibana Bay, western Japan, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C and delta(15)N, respectively). Stable isotope ratios of anchovy varied among seasonal samples for both delta(13)C and delta(15)N. In particular, the delta(13)C values were clearly segregated; winter samples showed higher values (delta(13)C{\textgreater}-17.5 parts per thousand) than spring samples (delta(13)C{\textless}-18.2 parts per thousand). Moreover, these differences corresponded to the geographical variations in previously reported stable isotope ratios for anchovy; higher values in winter corresponded to the values of inshore habitat and lower values in spring corresponded to those of the offshore habitat. Therefore the spring population is considered to have originated from the offshore region and recently migrated to the sampling regions, while the winter population would have experienced the inshore region over an extended period. Our results support the general concept of the migration of anchovy populations deduced by the fishermen of Tachibana Bay. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Developmental instability, measured as fluctuating asymmetry (FA; i.e. deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry), was studied using 2 otolith traits (maximum radius and perimeter) in larval anchovies collected during June 1994 and June 1995 in the northern Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean). There was a substantial between-year difference, FA being greater in 1995 than in 1994: mean absolute asymmetry in otolith perimeter was 265{\%} higher in 1995 than in 1994. Similarly, 3 'growth' relationships (standard length, SL, anal body depth, ABD, and recent otolith growth, ROG, on age, A) and 2 'allometric' ones (ABD and ROG on SL) were significantly different between the 2 years and indicated that anchovy larvae collected during 1994 were in better condition than those collected in 1995. These between-year differences could be explained in terms of Lasker's 'stable-ocean hypothesis'. Stability of the upper water column was higher in 1994 than in 1995. Subsequently, we examined asymmetry at the level of the individual: using the residuals of the 5 models as indices of condition, cases of significant negative correlation between asymmetry and the residual-based indices were found, a fact which seemed to depend mainly on the otolith trait and the residual variance of the model used to derive the index of condition. These field results suggest that developmental instability, as measured by bilateral asymmetry of the otoliths, can be used as an indicator of condition in larval fish.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the pelagic vertical distribution of fish eggs is central for several aspects of fisheries science including fisheries recruitment and egg production studies. In modelling egg vertical distributions, variation in fish egg density is an important issue. Though variation in egg density between individual eggs has been reported, evidence for significant spatial variation in egg density is novel. The present study provides evidence that egg density of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) varies spatially across spawning sites in the Bay of Biscay, depending on the regional scale variation in sea water properties due to river discharge. We measured the density of the eggs using a density gradient column at 17 stations in 2005 and 2006 as well as their diameter. At station, the variability in the individual egg density was statistically distributed according to a Gaussian probability function. Significant variation in the mean egg density was observed across stations. Mean egg density displayed a significant correlation with sea surface salinity. Results are discussed in light of the mechanisms determining the egg density.},

abstract = {Investigations on the reproductive biology of the anchovy conducted during the 1987-1992 period in the northwestern Black Sea, the main spawning area of this species in this sea, are summarized. The spawning takes place in summer in the warm upper layer, within a wide temperature range (16-28 degrees C). Reproduction occurs mostly in coastal waters, especially in estuarine areas with low salinity (7-18 parts per thousand). The embryonic period lasts for about 24 hours (at 22.0-23.4 degrees C) and the pelagic eggs are elliptical (long axis: 1.5-1.9 mm; short axis: 0.8-1.2 mm). By late summer, some of the young fish born at the very beginning oi the spawning period may become mature at a body length of 55-65 mm and a weight of 1.2-2.4 g and take part in spawning. The spawning process is characterized by a clear daily rhythm: ripening and ovulation at about 9 p.m.; spawning from 9 p.m. to midnight; resting from midnight to 6 a.m.; forming of a new spawning batch from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Frequency of spawning depends on water temperature and varies during the spawning season. reaching its maximum-daily spawning- by the second half of June. On average, each female spawns more than 50 times a year. Individual batch fecundity depends on food availability, water temperature and body size. (Prepared by the Editors).},

Also, models were modified to allow for a statistical comparison between the egg development in the Gulf of Cadiz and in the Bay of Biscay. The Gulf of Cadiz data was obtained from an incubation experiment carried out during July 2007, where wild adults were collected, an in vitro fecundation was immediately performed and viable eggs were maintained in an on-land incubator at five different controlled temperatures (approximately 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C). Eggs were sampled hourly and classified into stages until they developed into larvae. The model of the combined data from the Gulf of Cadiz and the Bay of Biscay show no differences between areas, suggesting that for the same temperatures, the total duration of the egg phase is similar for the Gulf of Cadiz and for the Bay of Biscay.

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that year-class strength in marine fishes is determined in the early-larval stages, and that these stages can be used to predict recruitment, I modeled the recruitment process using a modified form of key-factor analysis. Using data compiled from the fish literature, I found a significant relationship (R2 0.90, p much less than 0.001, n 97) between the mean and interannual variance of stage-specific mortality rates that provided variance estimates for the model. The R2 values for the true correlation between abundances of small larvae and subsequent recruitment for four example species of marine fish were predicted to lie between 0.10 and 0.57, depending on the assumptions of the model. I therefore suggest that recruitment levels are fixed after the early-larval period. However, the precision of sample correlations are too low (10-yr data series) to empirically test whether abundances or mortality rates of early larvae are in reality strongly or poorly correlated with recruitment. After metamorphosis, the strength of the true relationship and the precision of sample correlations increase sufficiently to permit precise forecasting of recruitment. Recruitment is a complex process in which variation in all life stages contributes substantially to the variability in final abundance; therefore, researchers should recognize the importance of the later prerecruit stages and the interactions among all stages.},

abstract = {Larval mortality in marine fish is strongly linked to characteristic traits such as growth and condition, but the variability in these traits is poorly understood. We tried to identify the variability in growth in relation to conditions leading to greater survival chances for early stages of Cape hake, Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis, in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. During two cruises in 2007 and one cruise in 2008, hake larvae and juveniles were caught. Otolith microstructures revealed a larval age ranging from 2 to 29 days posthatching (dph), whereas juvenile age was 67-152 dph. RNA: DNA ratios, used to evaluate nutritional condition, were above the relevant threshold level for growth. No strong coupling between growth and condition was detected, indicating a complex relationship between these factors in the southern Benguela ecosystem. Merluccius paradoxus juveniles caught in 2007 (the surviving larvae of 2006) had significantly higher larval growth rates than larvae hatched in 2007 and 2008, possibly indicating selection for fast growth in 2006. High selection pressure on growth could be linked to predation avoidance, including cannibalism.},

abstract = {Recruitment success of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in the southern Benguela is thought to depend largely on the passive transport of eggs and larvae from their warm-water spawning area, located in the southern part of their distribution range (Agulhas Bank), to their cold-water nursery grounds located 500 km away on the west coast of South Africa. In order to test this hypothesis, the output of a 3D hydrodynamic model was coupled to a particle-tracking model, allowing the quantification of different factors such as the timing and precise location of spawning activity, the frequency of spawning activity within a month, the level of aggregation of the spawning stock, and the interannual variability of transport due to mesoscale processes. Results from the model indicate that spawning season and area have a major effect on transport success. The most favourable period for spawning was September to March, peaking in November, and the western Agulhas Bank was the most favourable spawning area. A low success rate of passive transport to the core inshore nursery area in the model suggests that additional processes such as swimming or advection are required for larvae to reach this area. In general, there was good agreement between observed spawning patterns and the optimal temporal and spatial strata where particle transport was most successful, suggesting that the spawning strategy of anchovy is mainly the result of an adaptation to the circulation patterns in the region. Nonetheless, some discrepancies were observed between the success of transport and actual spawning patterns, and temperature may also be an important factor to take into consideration to fully explain how this originally temperate species is able to survive in an area of highly contrasting temperatures.},

abstract = {Data on the thermal structure, copepod biomass and production, and total number of eggs of the Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis were obtained from monthly surveys during the periods August 1993 - March 1994 and September 1991 - March 1995 on the western Agulhas Bank and off the South-Western Cape, South Africa. Previous work suggested that anchovy spawn on the western Agulhas Bank in temperatures between 16 and 19 degreesC, where they feed predominantly on copepods. This study shows that the western Bank is a more suitable spawning area for anchovy, having greater thermal stability, a larger area of 16-19 degreesC water and a more consistent food environment than off the South-Western Caps. Also, copepod production on the western Bank was highest in 16-19 degreesC water. To identify factors controlling the area of this water mass, a cluster analysis was used on a suite of hydrographic variables. Three periods were identified: winter (August-September), spring (October-December) and summer (January March), reflecting changes in the extent of the 16-19 degreesC water and anchovy spawning, both of which peaked during spring. Spring was further characterized by infrequent surface upwelling. During summer, upwelling frequently reached the surface and the upwelling front migrated offshore, constricting the area of 16-19 degreesC water. It is hypothesized that spawning success in anchovy is dependent upon the extent of suitable spawning habitat, both spatially (16-19 degreesC water) and temporally (spring). To put this concept into a predictive framework, the number of anchovy eggs was regressed against the area of 16-19 degreesC water; a significant, positive relationship (p {\textless} 0.001, r(2) = 0.56, n = 17) was found. An implication of the hypothesis is that the duration of spawning may be important to recruitment.},

abstract = {Acoustic and satellite environmental data as well as bathymetry data were used to model the presence of anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus during early summer in the northern Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean). Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used for modelling and subsequently applied in a predictive mode to identify those areas in the Greek Seas and the entire Mediterranean basin that could support species' presence. Model results were evaluated with the estimation of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-plots as well as qualitatively, based on (a) acoustic data from concurrent studies in certain areas of the northern Aegean Sea that were not included in the estimation of the GAM model and (b) historical acoustic data from the central Aegean and Ionian Seas. Mapping the estimated environmental conditions in the Mediterranean basin indicated areas that generally agree with the known distribution grounds of anchovy, such as the straits of Sicily and coastal waters of Tunisia, areas in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Lions and the Catalan Sea.},

abstract = {Spatial variation in demographic parameters of the red throat emperor (Lethrinus miniatus) was examined among 12 coral reefs in three geographic regions (Townsville, Mackay, and Storm Cay) spanning over 3degrees of latitude of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Estimates of demographic parameters were based on age estimates from counts of annuli in whole otoliths because there was no significant difference in age estimates between whole and sectioned otoliths. There were significant regional differences in age structures, rates of somatic and otolith growth, and total mortality. The Townsville region was characterized by the greatest proportion of older fish, the smallest maximum size, and the lowest rates of otolith growth and total mortality. In contrast the Mackay region was characterized by the highest proportion of younger fish, the largest maximum size, and the highest rates of otolith growth and total mortality. Demographic parameters for the Storm Cay region were intermediate between the other two regions. Historic differences in fishing pressure and regional differences in productivity are two alternative hypotheses given to explain the regional patterns in demographic parameters. All demographic parameters were similar among the four reefs within each region. Thus, subpopulations with relatively homogeneous demographic parameters occurred on scales of reef clusters. Previous studies, by contrast, have found substantial between-reef variation in demographic parameters within regions. Thus spatial variation in demographic parameters for L. miniatus may differ from what is assumed typical for a coral-reef fish metapopulation.},

abstract = {Aromatic amino acids (AAs, phenylalanine and tyrosine) may be specifically required during fish metamorphosis, since they are the precursors of thyroid hormones which regulate this process. This project attempted to evaluate aromatic AA metabolism during the ontogenesis of fish species with a marked ( Senegalese sole; Solea senegalensis) and a less accentuated metamorphosis (gilthead seabream; Sparus aurata). Fish were tube-fed with three L-[U-(14)C] AA solutions at pre-metamorphic, metamorphic and post-metamorphic stages of development: controlled AA mixture ( Mix), phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr). Results showed a preferential aromatic AA retention during the metamorphosis of Senegalese sole, rather than in gilthead seabream. Senegalese sole's highly accentuated metamorphosis seems to increase aromatic AA physiological requirements, possibly for thyroid hormone production. Thus, Senegalese sole seems to be especially susceptible to dietary aromatic AA deficiencies during the metamorphosis period, and these findings may be important for physiologists, fish nutritionists and the flatfish aquaculture industry.},

abstract = {Although much sought, relationships between fish otolith size and somatic growth rate have not been established. This paper derives otolith size as a function of somatic growth rate from allometric relations of otolith size to body size and from the von Bertalanffy, logistic, and Gompertz (somatic) growth equations for an individual fish: generally, these relationships can be given analytically and (or) numerically. The relationships predict that for constant allometric parameters, otolith size decreases steadily with somatic growth rate for an individual growing according to the von Bertalanffy equation, whereas it first increases and then decreases with somatic growth rate for an individual growing according to the logistic or Gompertz equation. They are then used to reveal the complex relationships between fish otolith size and somatic growth rate in a case study for age-varying allometric parameters and in a simulation study for a group of individuals with different growth parameters. Because relationships between otolith size and somatic growth rate can be evaluated analytically and (or) numerically, this study provides an alternative approach to experimental study of otolith size as a function of somatic growth rate.},

The age of the fish caught declined in these three periods and there was an increase in the proportion of small-sized fish. The data suggest that the combined effect of the fishery and environmental changes have had an effect on the anchovy population.

In spite of being controlled by total allowed catches, the life history parameters used to estimate its abundance remain unknown. We estimated the basic biological parameters as growth, maturity and natural mortality for anchovy inhabiting the Chilean central north. The von Bertalanffy parameters were an annual growth rate (k) of 0.91 year(-1), asymptotic length (L(infinity)) at 18.72 cm, and age at zero length (t(o)) of -0.01 year. The maximum value of the gonadosomatic index in September and the high frequency of mature stages between July and December, support that the main spawning period of anchoveta in the area would occur from August to October of each year. The mean maturity length (L(m50{\%})) was estimated at 12.5 cm and the natural mortality (M) was 1.30 year(-1). The biological parameters of E. ringens located in central north of Chile are in concordance with the life history characteristics of small pelagic fish.},

Spatial distributions of juvenile anchovy and sardine around the Shatsky Rise area in the Kuroshio Extension region and the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region are described, based on a field survey in the late spring using a newly developed mid-water trawl for sampling juveniles. All stages of anchovy from post-larvae to juveniles were obtained in the northern Shatsky Rise area. The Kuroshio Extension bifurcates west of the Shatsky Rise area and eddies are generated, leading to higher chlorophyll concentrations than in the surrounding regions in April and May. When Japanese anchovy and sardine spawn near the Kuroshio front or the coastal waters south-east of Japan, their larvae are transported by the Kuroshio Extension and are retained in the Shatsky Rise area, which forms an important offshore nursery ground, especially during periods of high stock abundance.},

The homogeneity of the purified preparation was evidenced by both native- and SDS-PAGE, and further by gelatin zymography. Identities of aT-I and aT-II as trypsins were established by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, which matched exactly to the corresponding stretches of their respective amino acid sequences obtained by molecular cloning [Ahsan et al. (2000), Marine Biotechnol., in press]. Both isoforms were completely inhibited by serine protease inhibitors as well as by specific trypsin inhibitors. The purified anchovy trypsins showed considerably higher catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K-m) than bovine trypsin as measured toward benzoyl-arginine p-nitroanilide (BAPA) and benzoyl-arginine ethyl ester (BAEE) at 25 degreesC; in particular, aT-II was 35 times more efficient than its mammalian counterpart against BAPA. This was due mainly to a dramatic decrease of K-m values for anchovy trypsins, which are indicative of an evolutionary response toward increased substrate binding at suboptimal temperatures in the marine environment.},

Newly hatched larvae (NHL) were found mainly in water masses of 9-118 degrees C, pre-metamorphosis larvae (PML) around 5-68 degrees C, juveniles aged 0 in summer around 13-148 degrees C, and juveniles aged 1 in winter around 4-58 degrees C. The median salinity in which the NHL were distributed was 34.4-35.0 and 33.7-33.9, respectively, for PML and juveniles. Interannual variations in temperature and geographic variables in the North Sea were compared with the time-series of realized habitats. The realized temperature habitats of the NHL did not change over time, but the habitat of juveniles in summer may be associated with higher temperatures. Juveniles aged 1 in winter are found in waters colder than the average for the North Sea, a result also reflected in their geographic shift east into shallower water. The results suggest that juveniles could be limited by temperature, but may also track changes in food or predator distribution, and/or internal population dynamics. Time-series analysis of realized salinity habitats was not possible with the available data because of differences between model outputs.},

DNA was extracted from muscle of ethanol-preserved specimens using phenol-chloroform. The cyt.b gene and D-loop of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and ITS gene of gnome were amplified from total DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The double strand PCR product purified were sequenced using direct sequencing method. Genetic distance values were estimated using the method of Kimra's 2-parameter. Results Highest mutation rate was observed in the D-loop among the analyzed regions of pilchards. Since D-loop was sequenced in order to identify the local population structure of pilchard, no obvious genetic differences were observed among the collected sites. Thus, single population structure is suggested in pilchard from coast of Japan.},

abstract = {Age, growth and diet of anchovy were studied for the first time from samples collected in the Bay of Benisaf (west Algerian coast) during summer (spawning period) and autumn (recruitment period) 2007. Age structure and growth parameters were determined by otolith (sagitta) analyses. The von Bertalanffy growth function fitted to age-length data showed that most of anchovy growth is achieved during the first year of life, suggesting that this stock is primarily supported by the smallest age groups and has a strong dependence on recruitment. There were no significant differences between males and females, and pooled mean parameters were: L infinity = 15.61 cm, k = 0.75 per year and to, -1.32 years. Whatever the age-class anchovy is strictly zooplanktivorous. Copepods constituted the dominant group (64{\%} O; 81{\%} N), while other crustaceans, mollusc larvae and fish larvae were less represented. The main species of copepods consumed were by order of abundance: Candacia longimana, Oncaea mediterranea and Pleuromamma abdominalis. The results indicated a diversification of the diet in the first age groups (0 to 2 years), and a relative specialization in the third age group. Environmental factors including sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentrations were considered in order to explain differences in growth parameters and diet between different geographical areas. There was no significant relationship between the chlorophyll-a concentration and any growth parameter or L. The only significant relationship observed with chlorophyll-a was with the anchovy at age(-1). Concerning temperature, there was significant relationship only between SST and the anchovy size at age(-1).},

abstract = {In 1976 the North Pacific climate shifted, resulting in an average increase of the water temperature. In the Gulf of Alaska the climate shift was followed (i.e. early 1980s) by a gradual but dramatic increase in the abundance of groundfish species that typically prey on pre-recruitment stages of walleye pollock. In the present study we used a previously parameterized model to investigate the effect of these climate and biological changes on the recruitment dynamics of walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska. Simulations covered the 1970-2000 time frame and emphasized the medium-to-long temporal scale (i.e. about 5-10 years) of environmental variability. Results showed that during periods characterized by high sea surface temperature and high predation on juvenile pollock stages, recruitment variability and magnitude were below average, and recruitment control was delayed to stages older than the 0-group. Opposite dynamics (i.e. high abundance and variability, and early recruitment control) occurred during periods characterized by low temperature and predation. These results are in general agreement with empirical observations, and allowed us to formulate causal explanations for their occurrence. We interpreted the delay of recruitment control and the reduction of variability as an effect of increased constraint on the abundance of post age-0 stages, in turn imposed by high density dependence and predation mortality. On the other hand, low density-dependence and predation favoured post age-0 survival, and allowed for an unconstrained link between larval and recruitment abundance. Our findings demonstrate that the dominant mechanisms of pollock survival change over contrasting climate regimes. Such changes may in turn cause a phase transition of recruitment dynamics with profound implications for the management of the entire stock.},

@article{Borja1998,
abstract = {Various hypotheses have been put forward to explain the mechanisms leading to recruitment variability in fish populations. These have been based on either physical (wind stress, upwelling) or biological (food and predation) processes. In the Bay of Biscay, the hypothesis of a physical influence on anchovy recruitment has been confirmed. Oceanographic conditions in the Bay of Biscay in the spring and summer, influenced by north-easterly winds of medium and low intensity, seem to induce good levels of recruitment to the anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) population. An index of upwelling was significantly correlated with annual recruitment of anchovy (P {\textless} 0.0001) for the period 1967-1996. This physical parameter explains about 59{\%} of the variability in the recruitment of the Bay of Biscay anchovy. Two factors affecting productivity in the Bay of Biscay may be linked to northeasterly winds, namely weak upwelling and an extension of the area influenced by river outflows. Both of these factors, together with low turbulence and stability, may act to enhance survival of the early life-history stages of anchovy by increasing food availability. The potential use of this upwelling index to forecast the recruitment of the Bay of Biscay anchovy offers possibilities for improving the management of this population.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of water temperature, salinity and feeding regime on leptocephalus metamorphosis, and on daily growth increment deposition and strontium: calcium (Sr:Ca) ratios of otoliths in the Pacific tarpon Megalops cyprinoides. The tarpons at the pre-metamorphic leptocephalus stage (SI) were collected in the estuary, marked with tetracycline and then reared for 18 and 30 d in 2 independent experiments with different temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C), salinities (0, 10 and 35) and feeding regimes (fed and starved)-environmental conditions that the fish may experience in the wild. Temporal changes in Sr:Ca ratios from the primordium to the otolith edge of the reared tarpon were examined with an electron probe microanalyzer. At the optimal temperature (25 degrees C) in Expt I, the leptocephalus completed metamorphosis (SII and SIII) after ca. 2 wk irrespective of being fed or starved and reared in low (10) or high (35) salinity, although both somatic and otolith growth rates were lower in starved than in fed groups. However, in Expt 11, metamorphosis was delayed at SII when the larvae were reared close to winter water temperature (20 degrees C), and the duration of metamorphosis was reduced to less than 12 d when the leptocephalus was reared at 30 degrees C. This indicated that the rate of metamorphosis was significantly influenced by water temperature. Meanwhile, the drastic change in Sr:Ca ratios and increment width in the otolith of the leptocephalus during metamorphosis was also significantly different among different temperatures, salinities and feeding regimes in different degrees. The present study indicated that these factors significantly influenced the metamorphosis rate of the leptocephalus and subsequently their daily growth increment deposition and Sr:Ca ratios in otolith.},

abstract = {Daily growth of Atlantic juvenile hake from Northwest Iberia has been estimated employing a new approach combining analyses of transversal and sagittal sections of the otoliths along the ventral radius. Age of juvenile hake ranging from 3 to 25 cm collected during a spring 2002 survey was estimated. Somatic growth followed a power fit: Fish size (TL) = 3.3254*age(0.7336) (r(2) =0.87, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 76). yielding an average individual growth rate of 0.66 mm/day (0.06). The growth model indicates that after a year's life a juvenile can reach 25 cm. Otolith ventral radius ranged from 401 to 1842 mu m and daily increments were between 104 and 387. Fish growth and otolith growth were closely related (r(2) = 0.92 p {\textless} 0.001, n = 76). These first results of daily growth rates for the Southern stock corroborate the fast-growth hypothesis of this species. The evolution of increment widths from hatch dates onwards reveals important seasonal growth peaks during July-August and October-November. A comparison with prior data and discussion is also presented in the light of recent work on hake juveniles and tagging-recapture experiences. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Fish were exposed to 0, 0.4, and 0.9 mM nitrite for 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7 days, and levels of functional haemoglobin, methaemoglobin (metHb) and nitrosyl haemoglobin (HbNO) were assessed using spectral deconvolution. Plasma concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, chloride, potassium, and sodium were also measured. Partitioning of oxygen consumption was determined to reveal whether elevated metHb (causing functional hypoxia) induced air-breathing. The effects of nitrite on maximum oxygen uptake (MO(2max)) and critical swimming speed (U(crit)) were also assessed. Striped catfish was highly tolerant to nitrite exposure, as reflected by a 96h LC(50) of 1.65 mM and a moderate nitrite uptake into the blood. Plasma levels of nitrite reached a maximum after 1 day of exposure, and then decreased, never exceeding ambient levels. MetHb, HbNO and nitrate (a nitrite detoxification product) also peaked after 1 day and then decreased. Only high levels of nitrite and metHb caused reductions in MO(2max) and U(crit). The response of striped catfish contrasts with that seen in most other fish species and discloses efficient mechanisms of combating nitrite threats. Furthermore, even though striped catfish is an efficient air-breather, this species has the ability to sustain aerobic scope and swimming performance without air-breathing, even when faced with nitrite-induced reductions in blood oxygen carrying capacity. Our study is the first to confirm that high levels of nitrite and metHb reduce MO(2max) and thereby aerobic scope, while more moderate elevations fail to do so. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the low nitrite accumulation in striped catfish. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this work was to study the seasonal variation of the fatty acids in the three fish that are some of the best sources of n-3 fatty acids. The fat and fatty acid content of the investigated fish species show a significant seasonal dependency. Two of the fish (anchovy and picarel) have the highest fat content during the late winter-spring period. On the other hand, sardine shows the highest fat concentrations during the spring-early summer period. The fish that showed the highest variation in fatty acid composition was the anchovy. The sardine was found to be the best source of n-3 fatty acids during the one-year period (35.35 g/100 g fatty acids). Finally the picarel had the highest oleic acid content (on average, 13.89/100 g fatty acids). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) in genes of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (ND genes) were investigated by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Restriction of a 2.5 Kb PCR product coding for ND5 and ND6 revealed 53 composite haplotypes in 140 fish, 39 of which were unique. Mean haplotype diversity was 0.88; hence levels of variation were notably high. Pairwise values of nucleotide divergence ranged between 0.00001 and 0.01375, and gene diversity analysis indicated that an average of 7.6{\%} of variation was partitioned between samples (G(ST)). There was significant geographic heterogeneity, and Monte Carlo chi(2) simulations showed that Aegean Sea fish differed significantly from most other samples. Significant differences in the distribution of restriction patterns for one enzyme (Sau 96I) indicated that a degree of heterogeneity may also exist between anchovy populations in the Adriatic Sea and adjacent waters, although there was no intersample variation within the Adriatic Sea. Overall, the data were in accordance with the results of previous work using allozyme electrophoresis and meristics.},

The larvae in January-, February-, and March-hatched cohorts in the coastal waters grew faster and more uniformly than those in the oceanic waters offshore of the Kuroshio current. Growth trajectories of the three hatch-month cohorts were similar and could be expressed by the Gompertz model. The inflection points of the growth curves were reached at 9 to 11 d after hatching, when larvae were 10.8 to 11.8 mm TL. Maximum growth rates at these points were 0.80 to 0.85 mm d(-1). Growth rates gradually declined after the inflection points, and larval TLs converged into the infinite length of 29 to 32 mm, the sizes at which metamorphosis from larvae to juveniles is initiated. This asymptotic growth pattern in the larval stage resulted in the narrow ranges in TLs in spite of the wide range of ages of the larvae caught by boat seiners in the coastal waters. Slow growth and therefore long duration of the metamorphosing stage could be influential in determining the cumulative total mortality in the early life stages of the Japanese sardine.},

abstract = {Cyclopoid copepods can prey on freshwater fish larvae. The magnitude of predation is related to the size and concentrations of the cyclopoid copepods and the size of the fish larva; it is also likely to be specific to certain species. We studied 5-d-old larvae of sunshine bass (female white bass Morone chrysops X male striped bass M. saxatilis), golden shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas, fathead minnow Pimephales promelas, and goldfish Carassius auratus in four separate experiments. Larvae were stocked at 20/L into 2 L of water containing various concentrations of the cyclopoid copepods Cyclops vernalis and Mesocyclops vericans to ascertain the effect of predation on mortality. We also compared predation rates observed in this study with rates predicted by an empirical model of crustacean predation on fish larvae from the literature. Sunshine bass alone were susceptible to predation mortality at the cyclopoid copepod concentrations used in this study. Mortality at 400 cyclopoids/L was significantly higher than mortality at 0-100 cyclopoids/L. Mortality at 500 cyclopoids/L was significantly greater than mortality at any other treatment concentration. The observed predation rates were much lower than the predation rates predicted by the model. Stocking sunshine bass larvae at 4.11 mm total length or larger into ponds with fewer than 300 cyclopoids/L probably represents a low risk of predation. Golden shiners, fathead minnow, and goldfish larger than 5 mm total length that are stocked in ponds with fewer than 500 cyclopoids/L would also probably experience little cyclopoid copepod predation.},

abstract = {We developed a model of back-calculation of fish size from otoliths that could accommodate both changes in the relationship between otolith and somatic growth that occur through time and variation in growth rates among individuals. We used this model to back-calculate estimates of size and growth from otoliths of three species of Diplodus from the Mediterranean Sea. The outcomes of our model were compared with those of three other models and with growth curves estimated directly from populations of fish in the field. We found that our new model produced estimates of size-at-age that were closer to those observed in the field than the biological intercept, time-varying growth, and body proportional models. Comparison of profiles of increment width from otoliths of newly settled and juvenile Diplodus puntazzo and Diplodus vulgaris showed that these species formed a settlement mark, where increment width declined at settlement. In contrast, a settlement mark was not evident in the otoliths of Diplodus sargus. However, settlement of all species coincided with a sharp decline in somatic growth rate. Thus, growth rate may provide a means of estimating the timing of settlement in species that do not display a marked change in increment width.},

abstract = {The results of detailed morphological, experimental, field and modelling studies on various aspects of the trophic ecology of sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus in the Benguela ecosystem are synthesised, and differences in the trophodynamics of these two species are highlighted. Anchovy possess a relatively coarse branchial apparatus; feed predominantly by particulate-feeding and maximise their net energetic gain by using this feeding mode; show higher weight-standardised clearance rates than do sardine for prey {\textgreater} 580 mu m; are most efficient at assimilating nitrogen from zooplankton and excrete {\textless} 50{\%} of ingested nitrogen; feed inefficiently on phytoplankton and derive the bulk of their dietary input from larger zooplankton; and maximise their scope for growth on mesozooplankton. In contrast, sardine possess a relatively fine branchial apparatus; feed predominantly by filter-feeding and maximise their net energetic gain by using this feeding mode; show higher weight-standardised clearance rates than do anchovy for prey {\textless} 580 mu m; are most efficient at assimilating nitrogen from zooplankton but excrete {\textgreater} 50{\%} of ingested nitrogen; are able to feed on phytoplankton but derive the bulk of their dietary input from smaller zooplankton; and maximise their scope for growth on microzooplankton. These differences provide compelling evidence that anchovy and sardine are trophically distinct, and indicate that the two species show resource partitioning based on zooplankton size. The implications of these trophic differences for ecosystem functioning are discussed, and support the hypothesis that species alternations between anchovy and sardine, both in the southern Benguela and in other upwelling ecosystems, are likely to be trophodynamically mediated.},

abstract = {This study combines observational data with a two-dimensional numerical model results to determine the fate of fish eggs released in the Gulf of Kachchh (GoK), a semi enclosed basin on the west coast of India. Fish eggs were treated as passive particles in the model, and were released from probable spawning sites identified from the field surveys. Areas with retention of larvae above 30{\%} have been demarcated as nursery areas. Most of these nursery areas fall in ecologically significant sites which are rich in mangroves and reefs. We find that about 80{\%} of the particles are retained in the basin for all the three prominent seasons prevailing in the GoK. Complete retention of particles in the southern Gulf region and small quantity of flushing out in the northern boundary of the Gulf could be a major reason for sustaining an abundance of larvae in the southern Gulf. Trawler catch data at various sampling points also suggest abundance of fish in the southern GoK region. Model simulation of fish larval transport in the GoK reiterates the fact that fish larval aggregation occurs in the southern GoK during active breeding phase with varying dispersal patterns from spawning sites. Marine protected areas in the Gulf demarcated based on the ecological significance of sites reasonably corroborate with the areas of likelihood of retention of fish larvae differentiated by the model.

abstract = {In young temperate zone fishes, conflicting energy demands lead to variability in growing season and winter survival. Growing season survival is driven by size-dependent predation risk whereas winter survival is constrained by autumn body size, energy storage and winter duration. We developed a model of the seasonality of energetics coupled to empirical measures of resource availability, size-dependent predation and temperature seasonality for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in two sets of lakes in British Columbia, Canada, representing endpoints of a gradient of temperature, growing season duration and winter duration. This model was used to determine the energy allocation strategy which maximized first-year survival across these gradients. Survival was sensitive to the timing of the switch from somatic to storage strategies in cold, short growing season, low resource environments. A broader range of energy allocation strategies were viable in warmer, longer growing season and higher resource lakes. We used empirical observations of autumn energy storage and our modeled values for size-dependent minimal lipid levels needed to survive winter in each system to estimate winter survival for juvenile rainbow trout. Winter survival estimates were 6{\%} in cold lakes with low resources, 82{\%} in warm, lakes with low resources and 100{\%} in warm lakes with high resources. Fish in warm lakes with ample resources allocated substantially more to storage than the minimum required to survive winter generated from our model, suggesting additional selection pressures for increased storage when there was ample surplus energy. We concluded that growth-survival trade-offs, modified by seasonality of the environment, influenced the growing season energy allocation strategies for young-of-the-year fish, and suggested this may be important for understanding population viability across environmental gradients.},

Twelve samples of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton were taken with small Bongo (67 mu m) and Pairovet (200 mu m) nets during the spring of 2004 along two transects. The total abundance of zooplankton and the chlorophyll a concentration were higher in homogeneous waters, while total biomasses were higher in stratified waters. Temperature was negatively correlated with biological variables and was the main factor affecting the zooplankton distribution. In both transects, abundance peaks of first-feeding larvae were detected at coastal stations along with the smallest fraction of zooplankton ({\textless}500 mu m), while the largest fraction was dominant at the external stations, coinciding with the highest egg abundance. The physical structure of this front generates different levels of food availability for first-feeding larvae. Calanoids (southern transect) and cyclopoids (northern transect) are predominant followed by nauplii and appendicularians. The biomass of zooplankton preys contributes to the carbon transfer to the upper trophic levels and is probably important for the survival and growth of anchovy larvae in this frontal system.},

Two groups of juvenile cod were reared under different food ration and temperature regimes to obtain fish of similar somatic size but with different sized otoliths. The two groups were subjected to alternating temperature regimes and intermediate ration levels. Large otoliths grew significantly faster than the small ones and variation between individuals was extensive. The ratio of otolith growth during cold and warm temperature exposure did not differ between groups, and the observed growth pattern is therefore not attributable to differential growth within individual temperature periods. The ratio decreased with otolith size, presumably as a result of ontogenetic decrease in otolith protein composition. These results suggest that processes Coupled to the metabolic rate of the endolymphatic epithelium are the key driver behind otolith growth. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Estuaries of the Iberian Peninsula west coast are preferential spawning areas of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus (L.). This is an unusual reproductive strategy, since pelagic spawnings inside estuaries are uncommon. In order to contribute to the understanding of this reproductive strategy, a study of adult and planktonic phases of anchovy was undertaken in the Mondego river estuary (Portugal), where this species spawns almost exclusively in a brackish area of the upper estuary. This paper focuses on the daily period of spawning, the health condition of spawners, the batch fecundity, the spawning rate and the parental investment on reproduction. The daily spawning of the anchovy took place at dusk and during the first hours of darkness. Photoperiod: appears to be the most important factor determining the beginning of the daily spawning. The differences found in the absolute batch fecundity between age classes were only due to the differences in the average weight of each age class: no differences were found in the relative batch fecundity. During the reproductive season, the batch fecundity decreased, which reflects a reduction in the parental investment in reproduction due to the exhaustion of energetic reserves. With only one exception, the majority ({\textgreater}85{\%}) of females caught in each sampling date spawned or would spawn simultaneously, i.e. in the same day. This high fraction of simultaneously spawning females, together with both the predominance of males in almost all samples and the absence of immature and atretic females, indicated that sampled anchovies only represent a small fraction of the overall anchovy population, from which spawning schools migrate frequently to the upper estuary and return.

Sampling was carried out in early summer during a period of 4 years (2003-2006). Taxonomic composition and abundance presented high variability in space that remained relatively constant among years. Tow depth and indicators of trophic conditions in the upper water column (i.e., zooplankton displacement volume, fluorescence) explained significantly the structure of larval assemblages during all surveys. The northern continental shelf (Thracian and Strymonikos shelo, where a large amount of enriched, low salinity BSW is retained, was dominated by larvae of epipelagic species, mainly anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). Interannual changes in horizontal extension of the BSW seemed to match closely observed changes in the distribution of anchovy larvae. Mesopelagic fish larvae were particularly abundant beyond the continental shelf (over the North Aegean Trough) where a strong frontal structure is created between the low salinity waters of BSW origin and the high salinity waters of the Aegean Sea. Larvae of certain mesopelagic species (e.g., Ceratoscopelus maderensis) may occasionally be transported inshore when the prevailing current meanders towards the coast or feeds anticyclonic gyres over the continental shelf.

abstract = {A significant part of the variation in the early life history traits of fish can be ascribed to the parental origin of the individual larvae. The primary source of this parental contribution has been attributed to maternal effects and evidence for paternal effects is equivocal. Maternal effects are a non-genetic contribution of a female to its offspring but most reported maternal effects are products of both genetic and non-genetic contributions, i.e. female effects. In this study, parental effects on traits of larvae of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus L.) at hatch were investigated at one temperature using a 5 x 3 factorial mating design (North Carolina Design II). This allowed estimation of the true maternal effect and the additive genetic variation (heritability). Furthermore, relationships between individual traits were examined and for the first time nucleic acid content and otolith size at hatch were examined together. A significant correlation between the two was found and it is argued to support the notion that otolith growth is more related to metabolic rate than to somatic growth. Maternal effects were detected in larval weight and yolk-sac volume, while paternal and, hence, genetic effects appeared in larval length, yolk-sac volume, RNA: DNA ratio, and lapillar area. The findings suggest that an increased emphasis should be placed upon the importance of male influence on success of early larval fishes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The collapse and recovery of North Sea herring in the latter half of the 20th century had both ecological and economic consequences. We review the effect of the collapse and investigate whether the increased understanding about the biology, ecology, and stock dynamics gained in the past three decades can aid management to prevent further collapses and improve projections of recovery. Recruitment adds the most uncertainty to estimates of future yield and the potential to reach biomass reference points within a specified time-frame. Stock-recruitment relationships must be viewed as being fluid and dependent on ecosystem change. Likewise, predation mortality changes over time. Management aimed at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing mortality targets implies interannual variation in TACs, and variability in supply is therefore unavoidable. Harvest control rules, when adhered to, aid management greatly. We advocate that well-founded science can substantially contribute to management through improved confidence and increased transparency. At present, we cannot predict the effects of collapse or recovery of a single stock on the ecosystem as a whole. Moreover, as managers try to reconcile commitments to single-species MSY targets with the ecosystem-based approach, they must consider the appropriate management objectives for the North Sea ecosystem as a whole.},

Somatic growth rates were strongly correlated with seawater temperature. Both otolith growth and RNA/DNA ratios were correlated with somatic growth. Age at metamorphosis declined with increasing temperature, but there was no relationship between size at metamorphosis and temperature. Development seemed to be more related to temperature than to size. Large between-year differences were observed in the relationship between body size and otolith diameter. Otolith growth indices were used to compare back-calculated otolith growth between years or periods. In general growth was positively related to temperature, but early otolith growth was fastest at intermediate temperatures. It is proposed that the high temperature in 1989 had a negative effect on growth during the early larval stages, but a positive effect on the later stages.},

abstract = {Changes from coral to macroalgal dominance following disturbances to corals symbolize the global degradation of coral reefs. The development of effective conservation measures depends on understanding the causes of such phase shifts. The prevailing view that coral-macroalgal phase shifts commonly occur due to insufficient grazing by fishes is based on correlation with overfishing and inferences from models and small-scale experiments rather than on long-term quantitative field studies of fish communities at affected and resilient sites. Consequently, the specific characteristics of herbivorous fish communities that most promote reef resilience under natural conditions are not known, though this information is critical for identifying vulnerable ecosystems. In this study, 11 years of field surveys recorded the development of the most persistent coral-macroalgal phase shift ({\textgreater} 7 years) yet observed on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR). This shift followed extensive coral mortality caused by thermal stress (coral bleaching) and damaging storms. Comparisons with two similar reefs that suffered similar disturbances but recovered relatively rapidly demonstrated that the phase shift occurred despite high abundances of one herbivore functional group (scraping/excavating parrotfishes: Labridae). However, the shift was strongly associated with low fish herbivore diversity and low abundances of algal browsers (predominantly Siganidae) and grazers/detritivores (Acanthuridae), suggesting that one or more of these factors underpin reef resilience and so deserve particular protection. Herbivorous fishes are not harvested on the GBR, and the phase shift was not enhanced by unusually high nutrient levels. This shows that unexploited populations of herbivorous fishes cannot ensure reef resilience even under benign conditions and suggests that reefs could lose resilience under relatively low fishing pressure. Predictions of more severe and widespread coral mortality due to global climate change emphasize the need for more effective identification and protection of ecosystem components that are critical for the prevention of coral reef phase shifts.},

abstract = {Two sympatric flounder populations with different reproductive strategies, offshore spawning at 10-20 psu producing pelagic eggs and coastal spawning at 5-7 psu with demersal eggs respectively, inhabit the brackish water Baltic Sea. Salinity governs the reproductive success by irregular saline water inflows and hence stock abundance and distribution. The potential fecundity (the standing stock of vitellogenic oocytes in the pre-spawning ovary) was assessed for fish sampled at five locations (two for offshore spawners and three for coastal spawners) along the salinity gradient (ICES SD 25, 27/28, 28 and 29). Multiple linear regression analysis resulted in r(2)-values of 0.698-0.894 for the respective sampling location with somatic weight or total fish length as the main predictor, and otolith weight (proxy for age) and oocyte density (by gravimetric counting) as additional predictors. Analysis by univariate regressions using GLM revealed significantly higher fecundity for coastal spawning- than offshore spawning flounder (similar to 69{\%} more oocytes for an intermediate sized fish) but no intra-population differences. Similarly, gonad dry weight was significantly higher for coastal spawning flounder. Further, growth estimations indicated higher growth in offshore spawning- than in coastal spawning flounder suggesting that the coastal spawning population allocate relatively more resources into reproductive growth than somatic, potentially a result of strong selection for high fecundity of flounder producing demersal eggs due to poor egg survival for this spawning strategy. Earlier studies on fecundity of Baltic flounder are reviewed and discussed with consideration of inter-population differences questioning the idea of in general higher fecundity of flounder in the Baltic Sea.

abstract = {Measurements were made of the density and settling velocity of eggs of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), using a density-gradient column. These results were related to observed vertical distributions of eggs obtained from stratified vertical distribution sampling in the Bay of Biscay. Eggs of both species had slightly positive buoyancy in local seawater throughout most of their development until near hatching, when there was a marked increase in density and they became negatively buoyant. The settling velocity of anchovy eggs, which are shaped as prolate ellipsoids, was close to predictions for spherical particles of equivalent volume. An improved model was developed for prediction of the settling velocity of sardine eggs, which are spherical with a relatively large perivitelline volume; this incorporated permeability of the chorion and adjustment of the density of the perivitelline fluid to ambient seawater. Eggs of both species were located mostly in the top 20 m of the water column, in increasing abundance towards the surface. A sub-surface peak of egg abundance was sometimes observed at the pycnocline, particularly where this was pronounced and associated with a low-salinity surface layer. There was a progressive deepening of the depth distributions for successive stages of egg development. Results from this study can be applied for improved plankton sampling of sardine and anchovy eggs and in modelling studies of their vertical distribution.},

@article{Conover1998,
abstract = {One of the potential problems in stock-enhancement programs is the disruption of local adaptation that may occur when native gene pools undergo introgression with alien genotypes. Evidence for local adaptation in fishes, however, comes almost entirely from freshwater and anadromous species. In marine species, where geographic barriers to gene flow are usually absent, certain life stages are highly dispersive and/or migratory, and populations are few, the opportunity for local adaptation would appear to be comparatively low. I argue that such a conclusion is premature because few marine species have been rigorously tested for local adaptation. Patterns of variation observed in nature, whether based on phenotypic or neutral molecular characters, are not predictors of the pattern in fitness-related traits across environmental gradients, which may contain hidden (e.g., countergradient) genetic variation. The Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, for example, shows extensive evidence of local adaptation even though life-history and allozyme analyses would predict otherwise. Knowledge of local adaptation does not necessarily preclude stock enhancement and may, in fact, improve the chances for its success, but care to avoid introgression is necessary. Hatcheries can be important tools for establishing the existence of adaptive differences in life-history and other traits among stocks, because they provide controlled environments where the genetic contribution to phenotypic variation can be measured. If viewed as both research and production facilities, marine hatcheries could contribute greatly to our understanding of natural populations.},

abstract = {Otolith microstructure was used to examine settlement and growth of juvenile Rhombosolea tapirina Gunther from a site within Swan Bay, Victoria, Australia. A distinct transition zone on sagittae coincides with settlement from the pelagic larval phase to the benthic juvenile habitat. The daily settlement pattern was reconstructed using otolith increments from fish collected during and at the end of the settlement season. Settlement was continuous from July to October. However, most individuals had apparently immigrated from other settlement areas or were inaccessible to sampling for a brief period after settlement. The settlement pattern persisted over time, however, peaks were no longer evident at the end of the settlement season. The population growth rate of juvenile flounder was found to be approximately linear over the size range sampled, averaging 0.29 mm d-1. A significant linear relationship between standard length and otolith radius allowed back-calculation of individual growth trajectories for a 'winter' and a 'spring' cohort. Significant differences were found in growth trajectories for each cohort; growth rate over the first 20 d post settlement for the winter cohort averaged approximately 0.17 mm d-1 compared to 0. 23 mm d-1 for the spring cohort. The relationship between daily growth and air temperature was compared using cross correlation. Cross correlation functions showed a significant positive correlation at lags of 2 to 5 d for the winter cohort and a significant negative correlation at a lag of 1 d for the spring cohort. This suggests that early in the settlement season, temperature had a positive influence on metabolism, which in turn affected somatic and otolith growth rates. However, temperature apparently reached a critical level later in the season, which resulted in high temperature having a deleterious effect on metabolism, leading to a negative correlation between temperature and growth.},

Indices of upwelling and turbulence were built and proved significantly correlated with an index of annual recruitment of anchovy (p{\textless}0.0001). Both physical parameters explain about 70{\%} of the variance in the index of recruitment og the Bay of Biscay anchovy. The likely explanations for this relationship are outlined and discussed in the light of the current hypotheses about the processes determining recruitment of marine populations. Enhancement of the productivity and increased availability of food to the early life history stages of anchovy seem to be the main consequence of the prevalence of weak upwelling conditions in this area during spring.},

abstract = {In the Upper Klamath Lake basin of Oregon, we applied the member-vagrant hypothesis to larval lake fishes, documented marsh and hydrographic retention for larval shortnose suckers Chasmistes brevirostris and Lost River suckers Deltistes luxatus, and examined the effect of larval retention on the shoreline abundance of the juveniles of five species of fish in August. Emigration of larval suckers was highest from natal rivers, and immigration was highest in nonnatal areas downstream of the lake. Lake retention was facilitated by a wind-generated gyre and advection by an eastern boundary current. Marshes and other shoreline irregularities acted as traps that slowed river and eastern boundary current advection and retained larvae, especially for shortnose suckers, for up to 3 weeks. The interaction of behavior, seasonal spawning, and seasonal system dynamics appears to drive retention patterns. For both species of suckers and three minnow species (fathead minnow Pimephales promelas. blue chub Gila coerulea, and tui chub G. bicolor), the abundance of juveniles along the shoreline increased with distance from the lake outlet and was weakly related to lake elevation, a surrogate for available habitat. For these five species, 45.5{\%} of the variation in August juvenile abundance was determined by distance from the lake outlet. This work suggests that the nonbehavioral component of freshwater retention is complex and depends on hydrographic features, the boundary conditions of hydrographic features. and shoreline habitat.},

abstract = {In ever-increasing numbers, researchers wish to extract information based on chemical analyses from otoliths to determine movements and life-history patterns of fish. Such analyses make assumptions about chemical incorporation and interpretation that are beyond those that are important for stock discrimination studies, another common application. The authors aim to clarify the methods of determining fish movement based on natural and artificial otolith chemical tags and review current trends in determining movement using otolith chemistry, otolith sampling methods, and what influences otolith chemistry. Both spatial and temporal variability in water and otolith chemistries, which underpin the assumptions of several methods, are discussed. Five methods for determining movement and migration of fish are outlined: (1) estimates of movement and life-history traits of a single fish group, (2) assessing connectivity among groups using natural chemical tags in otoliths, (3) transgenerational marks to determine parentage and natal origins, (4) profile analysis to define life-history variation within a population and (5) profile analysis to describe movements through different environments. Within each of these methods, background information, specific hypotheses being tested and assumptions and limitations of each technique are provided. Finally, research directions required to fill current knowledge gaps and enhance the usefulness of otolith chemistry to determine fish movement are identified.},

abstract = {Gonosomatic indices and egg and larval densities observed from 1986 to 2001 suggest that the peak spawning season of the Australian anchovy (Engraulis australis) in South Australia occurs during January to March (summer and autumn). This coincides with the spawning season of sardine (Sardinops sagax) and the period when productivity in shelf waters is enhanced by upwelling. Anchovy eggs were abundant throughout gulf and shelf waters, but the highest densities occurred in the northern parts of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent where sea surface temperatures (SST) were 24-26degreesC. In contrast, larvae {\textgreater}10 mm total length (TL) were found mainly in shelf waters near upwelling zones where SSTs were relatively low ({\textless}20degreesC) and levels of chlorophyll a (chl a) relatively high. Larvae {\textgreater}15 mm TL were collected only from shelf waters near upwelling zones. The high levels of larval abundance in the upwelling zones may reflect higher levels of recruitment to later stages in these areas compared with the gulfs. The sardine spawns mainly in shelf waters; few eggs and no larvae were collected from the northern gulfs. The abundance of anchovy eggs and larvae in shelf waters increased when sardine abundance was reduced by large-scale mortality events, and decreased as the sardine numbers subsequently recovered. We hypothesize that the upwelling zones provide optimal conditions for the survival of larval anchovy in South Australia, but that anchovy can only utilize these zones effectively when the sardine population is low. At other times, northern gulf waters of South Australia may provide a refuge for the anchovy that the sardine cannot utilize.},

Eucalanus bungii has a diapause from August to March at copepodite stages between copepodite 3 (C3) and C6 female. We propose that individuals with early birth dates are young of overwintering C5 and C6-females that develop to C4 in their birth year, while individuals with late birth dates are young of overwintering C4 that develop to C3 in their birth year. Thus, a majority of the population has annual generations alternating with biennial generations. Neocalanus cristatus showed life history almost identical to the population in the Alaskan gyre. Timing of the life cycle in N. cristatus is very close to that in the eastern subarctic gyre, but that of E. bungii is 2 months earlier than in the eastern subarctic. This difference is probably caused by the timing difference in the maximum primary production in the two areas and the plasticity of the life cycle strategy in E. bungii.},

The aims of this study were to (1) clarify larval dispersal processes and settlement sites, and (2) evaluate the existing harvest refugium and estimate the suitability of other areas for larval sources, using this model. In the larval dispersal simulations, particles were released at the time of hatching, which was calculated from the estimated time of fertilization/potential spawning and based upon the water temperature. The results of larval dispersal simulations indicate 2 different dispersal patterns: (1) transport toward the coast after dispersal offshore, and (2) gradual dispersal offshore. The refugium was compared with 3 hypothetical reproductive sources located 1 km north, west, and south of the refugium. During settlement competency, transport success (transport to the area at the depth of adult habitat: ≤ 30 m) of particles released at the refugium was highest (27 to 75{\%}), and suggested that the location of this refugium was more suitable for a larval source than those of the hypothetical reproductive sources. Multiple potential larval settlement sites were identified. These results have important implications for refugium design at the study site. The method and model developed in the present study could be used for evaluating harvest refugia and for identifying effective locations for reproductive sources and potential settlement sites.},

abstract = {An individual-based model (IBM) of anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) larvae was coupled to a climatological hydrodynamic (Regional Oceanic Modeling System, ROMS) model for central-southern Chile to answer the question as to whether or not across- and alongshore transport off central-southern Chile enhances retention in the spawning areas during the winter and summer reproductive periods, using model-based pre-recruitment indices (simulated transport success to nursery areas). The hydrodynamic model validation showed that ROMS captures the mean Seas Surface Temperature and Eddie Kinetic Energy observed in satellite-based data over the entire region. The IBM was used to simulate the transport of eggs and larvae from spawning zones in central Chile (Constitucion, Dichato, Gulf of Arauco and Lebu-Corral) to historical nursery areas (HRZ, region between 35 degrees S and 37 degrees S). Model results corroborated HRZ as the most successful pre-recruitment zone (particles originated in the Dichato and Gulf of Arauco spawning areas), as well as identifying Lebu-Corral as a zone of high retention with a high associated pre-recruitment index (particles originated in the Lebu-Corral spawning zone). The highest pre-recruitment values were mainly found in winter. The Constitucion and Dichato spawning zones displayed a typical summer upwelling velocity pattern, while the Gulf of Arauco in summertime showed strong offshore and alongshore velocity components. The Lebu-Corral region in winter presented important near-surface cross-shore transport towards the coast (associated with downwelling events), this might be one of the major mechanisms leading to high retention levels and a high pre-recruitment index for Lebu-Corral spawning zone. The limitations of the modeling approach are discussed and put into perspective for future work. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A life cycle model for Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) was developed to clarify the possible causes of interannual and decadal variability in its abundance. In the model, the population of saury is composed of two spawning cohorts: one spawned in the Kuroshio region during autumn-winter and the other spawned in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Transition Zone during winter-spring. The life cycle of saury was divided into six stages: namely egg, larval, juvenile, young, immature and adult stages. The life cycle model combines growth, survival, fishing and reproductive processes, in which the effects of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Kuroshio region and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on the winter-spawning cohorts, the effects of SST in the Oyashio region on the spring-spawning cohorts, and the effects of fishing on the two spawning cohorts are taken into account. Results of basic modeling, in which environments are assumed stable and the stock is affected by fishing only, shows that the interannual fluctuations in the abundance are small and could hardly explain the observed large annual changes in abundance. On the contrary, results of modeling incorporating the effects of oceanic-climatic changes corresponded well with actual interannual-decadal variations in abundance. These results suggest the following environmental effects: (1) SST in the Kuroshio region affects decadal changes in abundance; (2) ENSO events influence the survival of the winter spawning cohort and result in large inter-annual variations in the abundance. It is concluded that tar-e-Scale climatic and oceanic changes strongly affect the abundance of saury.},

The scallop fishing grounds consist of a number of scallop beds dispersed throughout the St George's Channel and the southern Irish Sea. The boundaries between stocks and the interconnection in populations of adult scallops, through larval transport, is generally unknown. Until the time of this research, the stocks of scallop in this region had not been assessed. A research project was undertaken to develop novel, spatially explicit and multi-disciplinary approaches to the assessment of the scallop fisheries in the region. The project supported research in three related areas under the broad objective of developing stock assessment protocols and methods in order to promote sustainable management of these fisheries. One of these areas was the development and application of numerical models. The objectives of this modelling research were: ( a) to reconstruct the physical environment of the study area; ( b) investigate how this environment affects the demographics and nature of scallop; and ( c) determine migration-transport pathways of the scallop larvae. From these investigations, light is shed on how the spatial variability in certain parameters of the natural environment determine habitats and the scallop populations. Also, the investigations now enable determinations to be made on the interconnectivities of 'disparate' scallop beds and where larvae are, in general, likely to be found. Thus, through the use of complex computer models, important clues are deduced that enable us to now understand key behavioural components of scallop larvae and their transport pathways. The analysis of these clues is assisting the development of protocols for managing the fish stock in a sustainable manner.},

abstract = {Ontogenetic variation in the diet of Engraulis encrasicolus (L.) was examined in the northern Adriatic Sea, off the River Po delta, by stomach contents analysis. Anchovy (10 to 130 mm total length) were collected during a 1 wk cruise in October 2002. Feeding activity was mainly diurnal in all the length classes: stomach fullness, calculated for each 10 mm size class, was always higher during the day than at night, with maximal values measured for the 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 mm. size classes. All analysed life stages of E. encrasicolus had a strictly zooplanktivorous diet based on a few species of copepods. The principal prey of E. encrasicolus were small-sized copepods, measuring about 0.2 to 0.3 or 0.5 to 0.6 mm in prosoma length. The copepods Euterpina acutifrons and Oncaea spp. dominated anchovy diet during the day, both in terms of frequency, number and biomass, in all anchovy size classes. During the night, bivalve larvae were also important dietary items, with Oncaea spp. and E. acutifrons making up {\textgreater}69{\%} of total prey number for all anchovy size classes. Within the considered size range, the dimensions of particles does not seem to be a limiting factor in food selection, and no relationship was found between anchovy length and the maximal dimension of ingested prey. Ivlev's electivity index confirmed that European anchovy was able to select specific food items and preferred small copepods such as E. acutifrons and Oncaea spp., and bivalve and decapod larvae.},

abstract = {increment formation in sagittal otoliths, scaling between otolith and somatic growth, and the temporal Link between settlement and formation of a settlement mark in otolith structure were evaluated for their use in reconstructing aspects of the early life history of the basalt goby Bathygobius coalitus. Formation of daily increments was validated in sagittae of fish ranging in Life history stage from new recruits to sexually differentiated males and females. Total length (TL) was proportional to other measures of body length, width, and depth, and Linearly proportional to sagitta radius for fish between 8 and 40 mm TL. Somatic-otolith scaling became more curvilinear in larger fish due to declining growth rate of otoliths relative to TL, especially in fish collected during warmer sea surface temperatures. For fish 8 to 40 mm TL, somatic-otolith scaling was not affected by differential somatic growth rates nor by seasonal water temperature. A settlement mark, clearly identifiable as a distinct and abrupt shift in optical focal plane, contrast, and width of daily increments, was verified to coincide with settlement. Wider post-settlement increments abruptly followed narrower pre-settlement increments across the settlement mark. These results support the use of daily increments, somatic-otolith scaling, and a settlement mark for reconstruction of hatch and settlement dates, mean daily pre- and post-settlement growth rates, size and age at settlement, and post-settlement size-at-age histories for the basalt goby.},

abstract = {In order to achieve spawning in captive Engraulis ringens that would result in eggs and larvae for experimental assays, the present work evaluated the effect of buserelin acetate (an analogue of GnRH; GnRHa) injections on spawning and spermiation. Domperidone (DOM) was also used in order to reject a possible dopaminergic control in the release of endogenous gonadotropins for this species. Ripe fish were injected intraperitoneally with 0.005 mu g GnRHa g(-1) fish (H), 0.005 mu g GnRHa g(-1) fish + 0.01 mg DOM g(-1) fish (HD) or saline solution at 0.9{\%} (SS). The GnRHa and GnRHa+DOM treatments showed an inductor effect on spawning, which occurred between 24 and 48 h post injection (p.i.). The results were significantly different (P {\textless} 0.05), with total percentages of 57.3{\%} (GnRHa) and 20.9{\%} (GnRHa+DOM). The effect of the hormone on spermiation was immediate, with the GnRHa (44.4{\%}) treatment, and percentages of spermiated males at 0 hours p.i. differed significantly from the control (P {\textless} 0.05). Spermiation was highest 12 hours p.i., with values of 85.7{\%} (GnRHa) and 75.0{\%} (GnRHa+DOM). These values did not differ significantly (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Our results indicate the absence of a dopaminergic control in this species, since gametes were expelled with or without domperidone. On the contrary, the percentages of spawned and spermiated fish after being injected with DOM were significantly lower.},

Juvenile 0-group cod were collected around Iceland in August 1996 and 1997 to establish the spatial distribution of otolith chemistry at the juvenile stage. Spawning cod from the same year classes were sampled in the same areas in April 2002 and April/May 2003. The core, corresponding to the juvenile otolith, was extracted from the adult otolith and its content of Ba, Mn, and Sr compared with the chemistry of whole otoliths of juveniles of the same year class. High Atlantic inflow into the shelf area north of Iceland in 1997 mixed the juveniles from different areas, and the spawners of that year class were not backtraceable to their origin. For the 1996 year class, however, mixed-stock analysis indicated that most of the spawning cod northwest, north, and northeast of Iceland originated from juveniles off the central part of the north coast. Using otolith chemistry to backtrace the origin of spawners appears well suited for areas with limited mixing, but less well suited for areas or years of high current velocity.},

abstract = {Relationships between fish length, otolith size, age and weight were assessed for a population of wild Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) larvae and juveniles captured over a 4-year period to aid further interpretation of growth and condition during the early life history of the species. Nonlinear smoothed generalized additive models best described the fish-otolith size relationship during the larval and juvenile period, indicating that the proportionality between fish length and otolith size varies in relation to size. It is proposed that back-calculated predictions of fish size at a previous age or otolith size, accounting for individual variation is possible by assuming a body proportional hypothesis. Growth rate of larval and juvenile Australian smelt was best described using the Gompertz model that indicated a steady decline in growth rate after around 30 days of age. The allometric growth of larval and juvenile Australian smelt established from the length/weight relationship can subsequently be used to assess the condition of fish within this population using a relative condition or relative weight condition index. The results of the study have provided significant information to enable more precise growth reconstruction and condition assessment for the species in Australian lowland rivers.},

Temperature was found to have a significant effect on the increment deposition rate and otolith growth. A daily increment deposition rate was confirmed in larvae reared under conditions of higher temperatures (20.8 and 22.3 degrees C), while the apparent rate of increment formation of larvae reared at 17.6 degrees C was clearly lower. Standard length and otolith radius were closely related and this relationship was affected by both temperature and growth rates.

In the Baltic Sea, Paracalanus spp. and Pseudocalanus spp. were important in relative terms; in the German Bight, Temora spp. dominated the stomach contents. Relative abundances of prey items varied with area more than absolute abundance or presence absence of items. Moreover, the level of resolution of prey categories influenced which prey categories were considered to be most important in driving variability in stomach content. Anchovy diet is broad across the seasons, years and areas sampled, suggesting that it is not a specialist feeder in the North Sea.

@article{Bakun2006,
abstract = {Many marine ecosystems exhibit a characteristic "wasp-waist" structure, where a single species, or at most several species, of small planktivorous fishes entirely dominate their trophic level. These species have complex life histories that result in radical variability that may propagate to both higher and lower trophic levels of the ecosystem. In addition, these populations have two key attributes: (1) they represent the lowest trophic level that is mobile, so they are capable of relocating their area of operation according to their own internal dynamics; (2) they may prey upon the early life stages of their predators, forming an unstable feedback loop in the trophic system that may, for example, precipitate abrupt regime shifts. Experience with the typical "boom-bust" dynamics of this type of population, and with populations that interact trophically with them, suggests a "predator pit" type of dynamics. This features a refuge from predation when abundance is very low, very destructive predation between an abundance level sufficient to attract interest from predators and an abundance level sufficient to satiate available predators, and, as abundance increases beyond this satiation point, decreasing specific predation mortality and population breakout. A simple formalism is developed to describe these dynamics. Examples of its application include (a) a hypothetical mechanism for progressive geographical habitat expansion at high biomass, (b) an explanation for the out-of-phase alternations of abundances of anchovies and sardines in many regional systems that appear to occur without substantial adverse interactions between the two species groups, and (c) an account of an interaction of environmental processes and fishery exploitation that caused a regime shift. The last is the example of the Baltic Sea, where the cod resource collapsed in concert with establishment of dominance of that ecosystem by the cod's 'wasp-waist" prey, herring and sprat.

abstract = {The massive spawning of anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) in Argentine waters takes place in spring in the coastal sector off the Buenos Aires Province, with the highest concentrations of spawners occurring in front of the Rio de la Plata mouth. In October 1995, the size structure, composition and abundance of the zooplankton community was analyzed and related to the hydrography and the abundance of anchovy eggs. Oceanographic conditions were different from the recorded means for the season. A higher proportion of the colder and more saline shelf waters were present in the coastal area and strong haloclines were not observed. High values of plankton biomass were observed in the estuarine frontal area and in the weakly stratified waters of the median shelf. The cluster analysis of the stations gave rise to the formation of coastal (CA), transitional (TA) and shelf (SA) faunistic areas. Mesozooplankton smaller than 1 mm total length (TL) dominated the whole area. The copepods, Paracal anus spp. and Oithona similis, and the cladocerans, Evadne nordmanni and Podon spp., constituted the bulk of this mesozooplankton fraction. Oithona similis was the dominant species in the SA. The copepod, Acartia tonsa (1-2 mm TL), was extremely abundant in the estuarine front (more than 17600 individuals m(-3)) followed by appendicularians, members of Pseudocalanidae, anchovy eggs and decapod larvae. Species of Calanidae (Calanoides carinatus and Calanus simillimus), the amphipod hyperiid, Themisto gaudichaudii, and the euphausiid, Euphausia lucens, largely dominated the macrozooplankton ({\textgreater} 2 mm TL) in the TA and SA. In the CA, significant positive correlations between the abundance of small copepods (size ranges {\textless}1 and 1-2 mm) and anchovy eggs were found. Trophic implications of these findings for first-feeding anchovy larvae were discussed. The adequacy of the TA and SA as feeding ground for adults of anchovy was evaluated.},

abstract = {A new biochemical index was used to assess larval fish nutritional condition during a. survey cruise in the Bay of Biscay in early June 1993. This period corresponds to the breeding season of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus L.). The analysis of samples taken at grid points indicated a clear spatial pattern in nutritional condition, which increased from the middle shelf to the shelf edge. A relatively large fraction of the larval population proved to be in poor condition. Strong winds with speeds of 20-30 knots occurred during 3 d after the first survey and affected the vertical hydrological structure. During a subsequent survey, samples taken at approximately the same locations showed that anchovy larvae in all areas were in very poor condition. These results support the notion that some environmental stability is required for good feeding conditions. Strong winds are not uncommon in the Bay of Biscay and their potential effects on anchovy recruitment variability are discussed. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {A bioenergetics model is implemented for European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and applied to the north-eastern Aegean Sea (eastern Mediterranean Sea). The model reproduces the growth of anchovy in a one-way linked configuration with a lower trophic level (LTL) ecosystem model. The LTL model provides densities for three zooplankton functional groups (heterotrophic flagellates, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) which serve as available energy via consumption for the anchovy model. Our model follows the basic structure of NEMURO.FISH type models (North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional Oceanography for Including Saury and Herring). Several model parameters were specific for the Mediterranean or the Black Sea anchovy and some others were adopted from related species and NEMURO.FISH due to lack of biological information on E. encrasicolus. Simulation results showed that the fastest growth rate occurs during spring and the slowest growth rate from August to December. Zooplankton abundance during autumn was low implying that decreased prey density lead to a reduction in anchovy weight, especially for the age-3 class. Feeding parameters were adjusted to adequately fit the model growth estimates to available weight-at-age data. A detailed sensitivity analyses is conducted to evaluate the importance of the biological processes (consumption, respiration, egestion, specific dynamic action, excretion and egg production) and their parameters to fish growth. The most sensitive parameters were the intercept and exponent slope of the weight-dependent consumption and respiration process equations. Fish weight was fairly sensitive to temperature-dependent parameters.},

abstract = {The histomorphological aspects as well as the histochemical content and distribution of glycoproteins (GPs) in the mucosa of the digestive tract of the anchovy Engraulis anchoita were studied. The buccopharyngeal cavity is lined by a squamous stratified epithelium with mucous superficial cells; the oesophagus shows two zones, cranial with a squamous stratified epithelium with mucous superficial cells and caudal with a columnar secretory epithelium. Finally, the stomach presents both the cranial and pyloric portion lined with a simple columnar epithelium. Tubular branched glands, formed by a single type of glandular cell, located along the stomach, are more numerous in the cranial portion. The GPs were identified with (1) oxidizable vicinal diols; (2) sialic acids and some of their chain variants, C7 or C9; (3) sialic acid residues with O-acyl substitution at C7 or C8; (4) carboxyl groups and (5) sulphate groups. Histochemical tests showed that the buccopharyngeal cavity presented the largest amount of the different types of mucosubstances. Epithelial secretory cells were found in the oesophagus, which synthesized a large quantity of sialosulphoglycoproteins likely to be related to a protective role. The surface epithelium of the stomach synthesizes and secretes acid and neutral GPs, probably related to the movement of fluids and to the absorption of easily digested substrates, respectively. Although great differences exist between different species, in E. anchoita as in other fish species, the wall of the digestive tract is composed of the four layers classically described for vertebrates. The GPs secreted by the epithelial cells are suggested to be important for the protection and inhibition of microorganisms. In additon, they are involved in enzymatic digestion of food, absorptive functions and lubrication of the alimentary tract.},

abstract = {A large number of northern anchovy larvae, Engraulis mordax, were collected in the Southern California Bight on two CalCOFI cruises during spring 1987, and the amounts of triacylglycerol, cholesterol and polar lipids were measured in each individual larva using the Iatroscan TLC/FID (thin-layer chromatography/flame ionization detection) system. The 1987 larvae were compared to larvae taken in the Bight during the previous year. Canonical correlation analyses revealed a significant relationship between the larval lipid components and physical/biological data collected at each occupied station during the late 1987 spring cruise, similar to that recorded in 1986. The short-term nutritional condition of the copepod Calanus pacificus was the most important station variable in both cruises. Their triacylglycerol:cholesterol ratio indicated that few of the 1987 larvae had been starving, but their very low contents of length-specific cholesterol and polar lipid indicated that they had been growing very slowly. Otolith readings on defatted larvae confirmed that the 1987 larvae had been growing significantly more slowly than the 1986 larvae. Furthermore, the data suggested that in the 1986 population the faster growing larvae were also those with the highest lipid content. This situation was reversed for the 1987 larvae, when the faster growing larvae in the population seemed to achieve their faster growth only at the expense of a lowered lipid content. The abundance of anchovy larvae was much higher in spring 1987 than in spring 1986 but, despite this, the apparent recruitment (number of Age 0 fish in July of each year) was not higher in 1987.},

abstract = {We examined sagittal otoliths from 398 gray angelfish (Pomacanthus arcuatus) collected from the lower Florida Keys between September 2000 and September 2003. Fish ranged in size from 78 to 442 mm total length (TL). Males had a mean TL of 329 mm (n=192), females had a mean TL of 308 mm (n=166), and an additional 56 fish were unsexed (mean TL=239 mm). Sectioned otoliths displayed clear increments that were used to estimate fish ages. Marginal increment analysis validated the formation of a single annulus per year. The relationship between TL and age was described by the von Bertalanffy growth equation L(t)=325.1[1-exp(-0.0601 (t+0.828))] for females and L(t)=388.5[1-exp(-0.383(t+0.923))] for males. Females and males grew rapidly for the first 5 years of life and eventually reached asymptotic lengths of similar to 325 and similar to 388 mm, respectively, with a maximum estimated age of 24 years. Morphometric parameters evaluated for use in the age model for gray angelfish included fish length and weight and otolith length, width, thickness, and weight. As with fish length, otolith length and width became asymptotic between the ages of 4 and 7. Otolith weight increased throughout the life of the fish, but the rate of increase slowed with age. Only otolith thickness was linear with fish age. Stepwise forward regression resulted in the following equation: In (age + 1)=1.157 + 2.542 x In(otolith thickness) indicating that otolith thickness. which explained 89{\%} of the variation, was the best predictor of age. Additional variables did not improve the regression, nor did dividing the data into subsets based on growth rate. Once the otolith thickness-age relationship was established, the simple process of measuring otolith thickness was as effective for determining the age of gray angelfish as the far more difficult process of sectioning and reading the otoliths. Use of similar models in ageing other species, along with periodic validation to ensure that the otolith parameter-age relationship has not changed over time, could simplify age data collection for population models. This, in turn, could potentially allow fisheries to be better managed at a significantly reduced cost. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {I simulated somatic growth and accompanying otolith growth using an individual-based bioenergetics model in order to examine the performance of several back-calculation methods. Four shapes of otolith radius-total length relations (OR-TL) were simulated. Ten different back-calculation equations, two different regression models of radius-length, and two schemes of annulus selection were examined for a total of 20 different methods to estimate size at age from simulated data sets of length and annulus measurements. The accuracy of each of the twenty methods was evaluated by comparing the back-calculated length-at-age and the true length-at-age. The best back-calculation technique was directly related to how well the OR-TL model fitted. When the OR-TL was sigmoid shaped and all annuli were used, employing a least-squares linear regression coupled with a log-transformed Lee back-calculation equation (gamma-intercept corrected) resulted in the least error; when only the last annulus was used, employing a direct proportionality back-calculation equation resulted in the least error. When the OR-TL was linear, employing a functional regression coupled with the Lee back-calculation equation resulted in the least error when all annuli were used, and also when only the last annulus was used. If the OR-TL was exponentially shaped, direct substitution into the fitted quadratic equation resulted in the least error when all annuli were used, and when only the last annulus was used. Finally, an asymptotically shaped OR-TL was best modeled by the individually corrected Weibull cumulative distribution function when all annuli were used, and when only the last annulus was used.},

The western Baltic spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) stock has been historically difficult to assess in a reliable manner. The population is spread between the Skagerrak, Kattegat, the Danish islands, and the western Baltic, but the distribution depends on age and season. Although the distribution area is covered by five separate surveys, none covers the entire stock. Using all time-series data may cause high noise levels and could lead to a poor-quality assessment. We examine the temporal and spatial coverage of each survey in terms of current biological understanding of stock distribution and, employing the observed internal consistency between age classes within cohorts as additional criteria, select the most appropriate data subsets. Assessments based on the revised dataset show greatly improved quality in terms of both accuracy and precision. The results highlight the often-ignored principle that a judicious choice of input data, based on rational and justifiable selection criteria, can enhance the ultimate quality of a stock assessment.},

Growth rates differed between cohorts, with higher growth rates for late-summer cohorts than either the spring or early-summer cohorts. Growth rate was positively related to surface water temperature, with an optimum temperature range of between 20 and 26 degrees C occurring during the late summer (late July through to mid-September).

abstract = {Historical catch records suggest that climatic variability has had basin-wide effects on the northern Pacific and its fish populations, such as salmon, sardines and anchovies(1-7). However, these records are too short to define the nature and frequency of patterns. We reconstructed similar to2,200-year records of sockeye salmon abundance from sediment cores obtained from salmon nursery lakes on Kodiak island, Alaska. Large shifts in abundance, which far exceed the decadal-scale variability recorded during the past 300 years(1-8), occurred over the past two millennia. A marked, multi-centennial decline in Alaskan sockeye salmon was apparent from similar to100 BC to AD 800, but salmon were consistently more abundant from AD 1200 to 1900. Over the past two millennia, the abundances of Pacific sardine and Northern anchovy off the California coast, and of Alaskan salmon, show several synchronous patterns of variability. But sardines and anchovies vary out of phase with Alaskan salmon over low frequency, which differs from the pattern detected in historical records(5,6). The coherent patterns observed across large regions demonstrate the strong role of climatic forcing in regulating northeastern Pacific fish stocks.},

Between 1984 and 1992, biomass of spawning anchovy fluctuated between about 0.5 and 1.75 million tons, Abundance of anchovy was significantly related to numbers of chicks fledged by African Penguins, occurrence of anchovy in the diet of Cape Gannets and numbers of Cape Cormorants and Swift Terns that attempted to breed. Numbers of African Penguins and Cape Gannets that attempted breeding probably also were influenced by abundance of anchovy. African Penguins and Cape Cormorants abandoned nests when anchovy were scarce and deferred breeding until anchovy became more plentiful. Survival of immature African Penguins in a period of anchovy scarcity was enhanced by availability of South African Sardine Sardinops sagax as an alternative food. When anchovy abundance was low, Cape Gannets fed on sardine.},

Larvae were obtained from ichthyoplankton samples collected from the outer shelf off Margarita Island and from Mochima Bay (northeastern Venezuela), between March 1999 and January 2001. Total length, standard length (SL) and height of larvae were measured and the otoliths were examined under a light microscope. Larval size ranged from 1.35 to 15.90 min SL, the Margarita Island larvae being signicantly larger than those from Mochima (t = 18.69; P {\textless} 0.001). The three morphological parameters were significantly and positively correlated among themselves and with otolith diameter and age, and fitted to a linear regression model; hence, size growth as a function of age was not different between the localities studied (SL = 2.65 + 1.10 x age; r(2) = 0.78, P {\textless} 0.001). Growth rates per locality were also determined by backcalculating sizes, with no significant differences (F = 2.60, P {\textgreater} 0.05) between them. The mean backcalculated growth rate was 0.99 min day(-1) and it was not significantly different from the mean growth rate obtained from fitted length-age data (F = 3.32, P {\textgreater} 0.05). Morphological changes in otoliths were evident from the mean daily increment widths, with wider increments in larval otoliths from Margarita Island (H = 42.54, P {\textless} 0.00 1).},

abstract = {Adult Japanese anchovies (Engraulis japonicus) migrate from the East China Sea to the coastal region of Taiwan to spawn around late winter and early spring and, later, their larvae constitute important fisheries in Taiwan. However, their migration route and its mechanism remain unclear. To investigate their spawning migration, we used a coupled fish behaviorhydrodynamic modeling approach. The physical field is simulated by the Pacific Ocean adaptation of the TaIwan Multi-scale Community Ocean Model (TIMCOM) and the fish migration by Lagrangian tracer tracking with the aid of approximation of fish swimming behavior. We investigated three fish behavioral scenarios: (i) passive tracking of the current, (ii) swimming along with the current, and (iii) swimming along with the current and then changing to swimming toward the optimal spawning temperature. The comparison with and without Changjiang discharge is used to investigate the impacts of discharge reduction due to the Three Gorges Dam. Our results suggest that spawning migration of Japanese anchovy from the East China Sea to Taiwan may be aided by the China Coastal Current and that adult anchovies cannot reach the spawning site by passive advection alone. Thus, the swimming behavior of anchovies is crucial during the spawning migration, as it provides extra velocity and the orientation to the favorable spawning grounds. In addition, the adult anchovy is unlikely to reach the coastal area of Taiwan without Changjiang discharge. Our findings indicate that a coupled fish behaviorhydrodynamic model can help understand the influences of physical environment on the migration of Japanese anchovies.},

abstract = {A hydrodynamic model was coupled to an individual-based model (IBM) initialized with conditions observed during 2004 to examine the influence of spatial and temporal spawning parameters on transport and survival of Engraulis ringens in central-southern Chile. Processes modeled were transport, growth, and mortality of the early stages. The results showed that spatial and temporal variations in spawning modulated the survival of anchoveta eggs and yolk-sac larvae. The resultant transport of the early stages had an important south-north direction. In terms of connectivity, the greatest transfer of eggs and larvae to the pre-recruitment zone came from four spawning zones. Retention occurred in all spawning zones and was strongest in the Gulf of Arauco and at Lebu-Corral. Mortality due to temperature and advective losses was more intense at higher latitudes (Lebu-Corral). Observed and simulated distributions of eggs and larvae were compared, and the differences are discussed herein. A conceptual model is proposed, and we discuss the relevance of IBMs as useful tools with which to assess spawning zones for purposes of management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Individual, geographic, and interannual variation in morphometric and life-history traits was examined and related to environmental variables. In the winters of 1984 and 1985, 1,836 otolith-aged northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) were obtained from 16 California-northern Baja California stations. Life-history characters were age, size (mean of logs of 11 morphometric measures), condition, and gonadosomatic index (GSI). Principal components analysis of 11 log-transformed morphometric traits adjusted for size and sex revealed five factors that summarized variation in (1) length of body, (2) length of jaw and operculum, (3) length of anal-fin base, (4) body depth, and (5) length of orbit and preorbital region. Independent variables used in further analyses were age, sex, size, year of sampling, year-class, distance offshore, CalCOFI line, depth of bottom, and sea-surface temperature at station. Within-station age-classes containing more than 13 fish were treated as independent subsamples (a total of 37). Morphometric factors, although independent of size, were found to reflect condition. Although GSI and condition were negatively correlated among ages within years, they were independent among subsamples. Only 0.7{\%} of individual variation in GSI was attributable to sex. Although there was overall positive correlation of GSI and size, the allometric relationship of GSI with size within a subsample (GSI slope) was negatively correlated with subsample mean GSI, signifying individual variation in reaction-norm allometry. Spatial heterogeneity was unexpectedly large for all life-history and morphometric characters. Two temperature-correlated, mesoscale spatial patterns were found: (1) of size, GSI, and GSI slope; and (2) of condition, body depth, and body length. Pattern 2 resembled published satellite images of a recurrent pattern of phytoplankton-pigment concentration, reflecting primary production. A third pattern of negative correlation of jaw length with condition and body depth was independent of temperature, year, and other independent variables. Year-class- and temperature-related differences between 1984 and 1985 samples suggested expected effects of the 1982-84 El Nino, but these were not cleanlyseparable from the much larger contributions of geographic variation. Heterogeneity within and among subsamples, particularly in jaw and anal-fin-base lengths, suggested heterogeneity of early environment, both among ages from the same station and within certain subsamples.},

Samplings were carried out in campings and villages, along the littoral of Ivory Coast where the seines of beach and the purse seines sliding are used for small-scale fishing in the depths from 6 to 10 m. The sex-ratio is 1:1.2 in favour of the males. The size of the first sexual maturity (L50) is 8.4 cm in the male against 8.8 cm in the female. The length-weight equation indicates that length increases more than weight (b = 2.5953 {\textless} 3). The macroscopic examination of the gonads showed that the species is immature between October and September (stages I and 11). In November, the gonads were at the beginning of maturation (stage 111) and maturation went on through December and January (stage IV) to reach in February and March stage V. The gonado-somatic index, was weak (0.09-2{\%}) during September-October, increased gradually to reach maximum value (6-7{\%}) in March when spawning can occur. The means of absolute and relative fecundities are 14 616 +/- 6146 oocytes and 1587 oocytes per gram of body weight, respectively. A linear relation was found between fecundity and total weight. Beyond the depths of 10 m no specimen of E. encrasicolus was captured during May to August.},

Under optimal feeding conditions larvae of more than 10 mm have higher feeding success rates than smaller size classes. With a simple body structure and low swimming capabilities, larvae of up to 10 mm show a low level of patchiness, low evasion rate of the sampling gear and feeding on small food particles only. Results corroborate the hypothesis of a critical period between two important ontogenic phases: the beginning of exogenous feeding and the onset of active swimming, gas gland buoyancy and school forming behavior.},

On all sampling dates, a reduction in embryonic yolk-sac volume, proteins and FAA concentrations occurred during development. Protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of eggs and larvae showed at least 22 protein bands: 11 were consumed early and not detected after hatching. The proportion of essential FAA (EFAA) was higher than the proportion of non-essential FAA (NEFAA) in early eggs and in 7 day-old larvae (82.5-73{\%} EFAA respectively). During egg development, the FAA pool was dominated by leucine, alanine and lysine, three amino acids contributing 35-44{\%} of the total FAA in eggs. During larval development, histidine was the most abundant FAA. In July, total FAA constituted 13-18{\%} of the egg dry weight. A similar proportion (45-51{\%}) occurred in July between protein plus FAA and total lipids. The differences in egg size during the spawning season along with variability in batch composition suggests that the female spawning condition is a major factor determining egg quality and early offspring success.},

abstract = {In seasonal environments, accumulated energy reserves are important to avoid starvation mortality during periods of low resource levels. Here we investigated patterns of energy accumulation and the importance of growth history for winter survival in young-of-the-year Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis). Under simulated winter conditions in aquaria, we showed that high winter mortality most likely relates to the depletion of energy reserves in small perch. Correspondingly, in a field study, using four lakes covering 3-6 lake-years each, overwinter survival within cohorts was positively related to individual size. However, average size in autumn did not explain the variation in overwinter survival between cohorts. Instead, we showed that seasonal growth history is an important factor. High growth rates late in season may increase cohort survival over winter, irrespective of average size, related to a positive growth-dependent increase in allocation to energy reserves when approaching winter. Mechanisms regulating within-season temporal dynamics of growth rates are therefore suggested to be important for overall cohort performance.},

abstract = {The amphibian metamorphosis assay (AMA) and the fish short-term reproduction assay (FSTRA) are screening assays designed to detect potential endocrine activity of a test substance. These assays are included in a battery of assays in Tier 1 of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. Based on our laboratory's experience with these two assays, we have noted several challenges in the conduct and interpretation of the AMA and FSTRA, including, but not limited to, diseased/parasitized test organisms, failure to meet some guideline performance criteria, and issues selecting and maintaining test concentrations. Various approaches are described for addressing the challenges associated with both the conduct and interpretation of these assays. Historical control data for both the AMA and FSTRA are presented to further understand background occurrences of histopathological phenomena and variability associated with the measured endpoints in these assays. In the historical control database for the AMA, wet weight on day 7 was the most variable endpoint (coefficient of variation = 26{\%}), while developmental stage on day 21 was least variable (coefficient of variation = 0.47{\%}). In the FSTRA, vitellogenin concentrations were the most variable endpoint (coefficient of variation = 47-84{\%}), while fertility was the least variable endpoint (coefficient of variation = 1.5{\%}) among historical controls.

Given its relevance for management, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the variability of catch of the world's main fisheries and their possible relationship to the environmental changes of the ocean and atmosphere. The FAO database for 1950-2000 was used to obtain landing time-series. Three hundred and sixty-one catch-series were selected, taking in account their historical average and the unequivocal identity of the target species; 131 from the Pacific, 191 from the Atlantic, and 39 from the Indian Ocean. The patterns of variation were identified by using two methods of cluster analysis: tree clustering and K-means. Three patterns were identified, for both the Pacific and Atlantic and only two for the Indian Ocean. Principal components analysis of 12 climatic indexes permitted recognizing three main modes, corresponding mostly to the tropical Pacific, extratropical Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. An analysis of the long-term variation showed a dominant pattern over the 50-year period, that has been related as the remote synchrony hypothesis fish marine catch. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The swimbladder of fishes is readily compressed by hydrostatic pressure with depth, causing changes in buoyancy. While modern fishes can regulate buoyancy by secreting gases from the blood into the swimbladder, primitive fishes, such as sturgeons, lack this secretion mechanism and rely entirely on air gulped at the surface to inflate the swimbladder. Therefore, sturgeons may experience changes in buoyancy that will affect their behavior at different depths. To test this prediction, we attached data loggers to seven free-ranging Chinese sturgeons Acipenser sinensis in the Yangtze River, China, to monitor their depth utilization, tail-beating activity, swim speed and body inclination. Two distinct, individual-specific, behavioral patterns were observed. Four fish swam at shallow depths (7-31 m), at speeds of 0.5-0.6 m s(-1), with ascending and descending movements of 1.0-2.4 m in amplitude. They beat their tails continuously, indicating that their buoyancy was close to neutral with their inflated swimbladders. In addition, their occasional visits to the surface suggest that they gulped air to inflate their swimbladders. The other three fish spent most of their time (88-94{\%}) on the river bottom at a depth of 106-122 m with minimum activity. They occasionally swam upwards at speeds of 0.6-0.8 m s(-1) with intense tailbeats before gliding back passively to the bottom, in a manner similar to fishes that lack a swimbladder. Their bladders were probably collapsed by hydrostatic pressure, resulting in negative buoyancy. We conclude that Chinese sturgeons behave according to their buoyancy, which varies with depth due to hydrostatic compression of the swimbladder.},

abstract = {Frontal disturbances of the Kuroshio and the Kuroshio Extension in the Pacific Ocean cause meso-scale eddies which contribute to accelerating local biological production. Temporal and spatial changes in nutrient and phytoplankton biomass observed in the vicinity of the meso-scale eddies in several recent research cruises revealed upwelling high primary production offshore, and suggested an uptake process by phytoplankton. Here we propose a newly developed "Upwelling-Production Diagram" for evaluating nutrient consumption in relation to primary production, and show that this diagram would be one of the more promising ways of estimating temporal changes in the biological production process from Eulerian observational data. In the Kuroshio Extension, according to observations and numerical simulations, maximum chlorophyll-a concentration in the eddy reached 3-4 mu g 1(-1) in 3-4 d, which is of the same order as the estimates found in the Kuroshio itself. This indicates that primary production caused by frontal eddies is a phenomenon occuring in both the Kuroshio and the Kuroshio Extension. In addition, the density of copepod nauplii increased with chlorophyll-a concentration in the eddy, and large numbers of eggs and larvae of anchovy were recognized at stations where the copepods were highly concentrated. It is difficult to explain how this physical phenomenon directly affects larval survival in the short period of one week, but this correspondence strongly indicates that frontal disturbances contribute not only to primary production, but also to fish reproduction.

abstract = {Aspects of the reproductive biology of the Bay of Cadiz anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus L., population have been studied from monthly samples taken from the Spanish purse-seine fishery during a four-year period (1989-1992). The spawning season extends from late winter to early autumn. The peak spawning time for the whole population occurs from June to August. However, larger anchovies (14-18.5 cm) are spring-summer spawners whereas anchovies in their first reproduction (11-13.5 cm) are mainly summer spawners. The sex ratio varies with size, females outnumbering males in the larger sizes. Annual sex ratios fulfill the theoretical 1:1 ratio, but vary seasonally. Maturity is attained at a total length of 11.09 cm in males and 11.20 cm in females. However, there are inter-annual variations in this size, suggesting a high plasticity in the reproductive characteristics asa response to the environmental factors regulating reproductive success. The seasonal cycle in anchovy condition appears to be related to both pulses in primary production and to the sexual cycle of the fish. Size-based differences in the energy investment in somatic growth and reproduction are suggested to explain the different reproductive patterns. The effects of a poor body condition in the anchovy ovary-weight cycle are discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The broad distribution of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) along the Pacific coast of North America makes it difficult for fisheries managers to identify regional stocks of this dominant small pelagic species. An investigation of morphometric characteristics of otoliths of Pacific sardine across most of their range revealed regional differences in populations. In a survey of over 2000 otoliths, all ages (with an emphasis on age-1 recruits) were compared. Principal components analysis, multivariate analysis of variance, and a novel method derived from regression and residuals calculations, termed perimeter-weight profiles (PWPs), revealed otolith similarities and differences. The results of the different approaches to statistical comparisons did not always agree. Sardine otoliths from Mexican waters were generally lighter and more lobate than those from U.S. and Canadian populations. Age-1 otoliths from northern California in 2006-07 tended to be heavier and smoother than those from other areas, including year-class cohorts from southern California. Comparisons of age-groups and year-classes of northern California otoliths with the use of the PWP models indicated significant trends in year-to-year patterns. In conjunction with other established indices of population structure, otolith PWPs are a useful tool for identifying local and regional stocks of Pacific sardine and may help distinguish populations of other fish species as well.},

In this study, we combine a suite of methods and theories in fish reproductive biology (oocyte packing density, stereology, ovarian allometry, oocyte size frequencies and postovulatory follicle [POF] ageing) to reconstruct the steps and timing of batch recruitment in European anchovy. Using general linear modelling to standardize oocyte numbers, we demonstrate that the fractions of primary growth, cortical alveoli and vitellogenic oocytes in the ovary are relatively stable in females with migratory nucleus oocytes (MN) or with POFs 1 and 2 days old (POF-1 and POF-2), but they change abruptly at hydration. These results imply that batch recruitment in European anchovy occurs in pulses of very short duration (less than a day). The standing crop of vitellogenic oocytes in MN, POF-1 and POF-2 females equals the number of eggs contained in two mature batches.},

abstract = {In the southern Benguela, successful recruitment of Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis is highly variable and seems to be dependent on the spawning biomass only to a small extent. This paper investigates how the variations in the drift patterns of larvae from the spawning areas on the Agulhas Bank to the upwelling-dominated regions on the west and south-west coasts of South Africa can explain these observed variations. Through the coupling of a three-dimensional circulation model, a Lagrangian particle-tracking model and spawning data, the number of particles ending up in different areas are used to investigate observed variability in recruitment. The model was able to explain 95{\%} of the observed variability in recruitment for the period 1987-1993 (excluding 1989) using a simple linear regression formula. The model also suggests that, of the interannual variability in currents and egg distribution, the latter is the most important cause of the changes observed in the recruitment of anchovy.},

abstract = {Juvenile walleye pollock of the Japanese Pacific population were collected from the Funka Bay [spawning ground; 16-64 mm fork length (FL)] in spring and the Doto area (nursery ground; 70-146 mm FL) in summer. Hatch dates were estimated by subtracting the number of otolith daily increments from sampling dates, and their early growth was back-calculated using otolith radius-somatic length relationships. Interannual change of the hatching period was observed during 2000-02, and the peaks ranged from mid-February in 2000 to early-April in 2002. In 2000, when a strong year class occurred, early life history of the surviving juveniles could be characterized by early hatching and slower growth in the larval stage ({\textless} 22 mm length). Higher growth rate in 2001 and 2002 did not always lead to good survival and recruitment success. Even though their growth was slow in 2000, the larvae hatched early in the season had larger body size on a given date than faster-growing larvae hatched in later season in 2001 and 2002. Bigger individuals at a certain moment may have advantage for survival. The delay of hatching period may result in higher size-selective mortality, and as a necessary consequence, back-calculated growth in 2001 and 2002 could shift towards higher growth rate, although abundance of such a year class would be at the lower level. Variability in spawning period, early growth and their interaction might have a strong relation to larval survival through cumulative predation pressure or ontogenetic changes in food availability.},

abstract = {Plankton sampling was conducted in the Baltic to obtain sprat larvae. Their individual drift patterns were back-calculated using a hydrodynamic model. The modelled positions along the individual drift trajectories were subsequently used to provide insight into the environmental conditions experienced by the larvae. Autocorrelation analysis revealed that successive otolith increment widths of individual larvae were not independent. Otolith increment width was then modelled using two different generalized additive model (GAM) analyses (with and without autocorrelation), using environmental variables determined for each modelled individual larval position as explanatory variables. The results indicate that otolith growth was not only influenced by the density of potential prey but was controlled by a number of simultaneously acting environmental factors. The final model, not considering autocorrelation, explained more than 80{\%} of the variance of otolith growth, with larval age as a factor variable showing the strongest significant impact on otolith growth. Otolith growth was further explained by statistically significant ambient environmental factors such as temperature, bottom depth, prey density and turbulence. The GAM analysis, taking autocorrelation into account, explained almost 98{\%} of the variability, with the previous otolith increment showing the strongest significant effect. Larval age as well as ambient temperature and prey abundance also had a significant effect. An alternative approach applied individual-based model (IBM) simulations on larval drift, feeding, growth and survival starting as exogenously feeding larvae at the back-calculated positions. The IBM results revealed optimal growth conditions for more than 97{\%} of the larvae, with a tendency for our IBM to slightly overestimate larval growth.},

@article{Dufour2007,
abstract = {Metamorphosis and puberty are two major events of the postembryonic development in Vertebrates. Based on some examples from fish species, we review the definition, role and regulation of these events, analyze their common and different features, as welt as their impact on the evolution and diversity of life cycles. The term of puberty, firstly defined in humans, has been subsequently extended to the first acquisition of the capacity to reproduce in all mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates as well as in invertebrates. By definition, puberty occurs only once in the life cycle. However, some similarities may be found with other events, such as annual re-activation of the reproductive function in seasonal breeders or sex-change in adults, as observed in some fish species. Metamorphosis allows the transition from one developmental stage in a specific environment to the next stage in a different environment, and includes a migration between the two habitats. Metamorphosis corresponds to drastic changes in body shape, physiology and behavior, and, unlike puberty, is encountered only in some phyla/species. In Vertebrates, the most described metamorphosis is the transformation in Amphibians of the aquatic larva (tadpole) into the terrestrial juvenile. Larval metamorphosis is also encountered in some other Vertebrates, such as lampreys and some teleosts (Elopomorphes and Pleuronectiformes). Less drastic morphological, physiological and behavioral changes occur in juveniles of some migratory teleosts. This is the case of smoltification in salmons and silvering in eels, which are referred to as "secondary metamorphoses". Investigations on the regulation of puberty and metamorphoses in Vertebrates reveal the crucial roles of the neurcendocrine axes. In all Vertebrates, puberty is triggered by the activation of the gonadotropic axis, constituted of brain neuropeptide (gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GnRH), pituitary glycoprotein hormones (gonadotropins: luteinizing hormone, LH and follicle stimulating hormone, FSH) and gonadal steroids. Sex steroids induce the morpho-physiological and behavioral transformations characteristic of puberty. Metamorphosis in Amphibians is triggered by the thyrotropic axis, constituted of brain neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), instead of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, (TRH), pituitary glycoprotein hormone (thyrotropin, TSH) and thyroid hormones (TH: thyroxine, T4 and triiodothyronine, T3), which play a key-role in the induction of morpho-physiological and behavioral changes. A similar control is suggested for larval metamorphosis in teleosts. Studies on smoltification also indicate an important role of thyroid hormones in secondary metamorphoses in teleosts, even though other hormones such as growth hormone (GH) and corticosteroids may be of prime importance. In contrast, recent investigations in the eel reveal that the gonadotropic axis, and ultimately sex steroids would be the major triggering control of silvering. The similarities of the morpho-physiological and behavioral changes between the two species indicate remarkable evolutionary convergences in the morphogenetic roles and target tissues of TH and sex steroids for the induction of secondary metamorphoses. In all cases, the possible synergistic role of cortisol is highlighted. Comparison of puberty and metamorphosis may also favor our understanding of the internal and environmental triggering signals of these postembryonic developmental events. In teleosts, the large plasticity in the occurrence and timing of metamorphosis and puberty, which contributes to the high diversity of fish life cycles, may provide new and relevant models to such investigations.},

Simulations were carried out for the winters of 1989 and 1996 to 2003. As they grew, the concentrations of herring larvae developed vertical behaviour. Meteorological forcing transported Downs herring larvae to the nursery grounds in the eastern North Sea with large interannual differences. Diet vertical movement was relatively unimportant in the transport of larvae in the hydrographically mixed southern North Sea. Year classes with less transport of larvae from the hatching area (which was generally warmer) were associated with greater abundances of young Downs herring in the ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey. This implies that retention, rather than dispersal or delivery of larvae to nursery grounds, is associated with the determination of year class strength in Downs herring.},

@article{Castro2000a,
abstract = {Previous studies on clupeiform reproduction have suggested that in upwelling areas of permanently high wind speed, winter spawning could be selected to promote the retention of offspring close to the coast, where more benign conditions are supposed to exist. The role of winter environmental characteristics, other than those conducive to retention, that could represent trade-offs within this strategy (i.e, larval food limitation, water temperature, intrusion of oceanic predators), however, have traditionally not been assessed. In the present paper, we assess the role of environmental variability on the winter reproductive strategy of the anchovy Engraulis ringens in an area close to its southern limit of distribution. A series of 8 cruises were conducted during the winter of 1995 in the coastal zone off Talcahuano (37 degrees S). Wind field, satellite sea surface temperature and hydrographic characteristics of the water column revealed strong short-term variability of oceanographic conditions in the nearshore area. During winter, upwelling events, a broad river plume and a cross shelf circulation were determined. Peak anchovy egg and larval densities occurred regularly at the nearshore stations. Increases in larval densities at an offshore station (12 nautical miles offshore) coincided with periods of coastal upwelling and the presence of a broad river plume, suggesting rapid transport of larvae from the coast. Maximum densities of gelatinous predators, in turn, coincided with the periods of minimum larval densities offshore, creating an apparent inverse relationship. Predators and larvae, however, did not co-occur in the same water masses, as revealed by the sea surface temperature and hydrography. Despite winter conditions, overall microplankton density in the water column was high during most of the season, with maximum anchovy egg and larval densities co-occurring with peak periods in larval food abundance. The coupling between maximum egg and larval fish density and specific meteorological and oceanographic conditions, the temporal and spatial decoupling between potential gelatinous predators and larval anchovies, and the overall benign larval feeding conditions close to the coast suggest that the timing of spawning and location of young anchovies nearshore may be part of a larger reproductive strategy of this species in the area.},

In the Gulf of Cadiz the mean anchovy landings after a negative NAO phase were significantly higher than after a positive NAO phase. A statistically significant negative relationship was obtained between the biennial NAO (estimated as the average monthly NAO values per two consecutive years starting with an odd-numbered year) and the probability of having an anchovy landing value for a year higher than the average anchovy landings for the entire year. Results suggest that the NAO previous to the landing year is an ecological factor of European anchovy related to its abundance in the Gulf of Cadiz.

abstract = {The discussions in the Villefranche Workshop covered a wide range of issues. The term regime shift was originally confined to spatial or temporal correspondences between climatic indices and population abundance. The body of evidence for physical-biological coupling has certainly generated a much better appreciation of the natural decadal scale variability in marine systems. It is difficult, however, to deduce from these time series, the mechanisms or trophic pathways that produce the correspondence. Ideally, we would need experimental manipulations such as those used in small takes, to unravel the causal connections. Since this is impossible in the open sea, we must use comparisons between systems subject to different types of perturbation or stress. We focused at the Workshop on the effects of over-fishing in different marine regimes. The consequences of large scale changes in community structure imposed by excessive fishing give valuable case studies. Coral reefs, rocky shores, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems provide other examples. The possible existence of similar processes across such diverse systems raises corresponding questions about common ecological principles. The adaptive benefits of maximizing resilience (defined as minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the perturbed system) were considered. The corollary of this assumption is that, at the limits of adaptation, there will be switching between communities, providing a potential ground for a broad definition of regime shifts.

To estimate size-dependent fecundity. growth and mortality of Pacific anchovy (Engroulis japonicus), the most abundant fish species in coastal waters off the Korean peninsula, we Undertook a synthesis of results from past studies and data. Assuming that the growth coefficient K varies with water temperature, we derived a modified von Bertalanffy growth equation covering all life stages based on otolith analysis of anchovies collected from southwestern coastal area of Korea in 1996. By revisting a past study on spawning and egg production of anchovies in the southern Korean coastal waters, we calculated a monthly-averaged fraction of mature females spawning per day to estimate that an average female anchovy spawns 36 times per year, and that the mean number of eggs produced by an average female is ca. 160 x 10(3) yr(-1). Accepting the 'bigger-is-better' hypothesis, we derived a theoretical mortality curve that assumes instantaneous natural mortality as an inverse function of anchovy body length. Assuming equilibrium status of stock, estimated annual instantaneous mortality of anchovy between egg to age-1 stage was 11.3 yr(-1) and estimated size-specific mortality was 1.24 d(-1) mm in fork length. The derived theoretical mortality Curve fit well the stage-specific mortalities, which were estimated independently based on ichthyoplankton surveys and anchovy samples collected by commercial nets, but underestimated the egg mortality (0.89d(-1) vs. 0.83d(-1)).

abstract = {In a mesocosm study, somatic and otolith growth of six types of juvenile cyprinids differing in body size and body shape were studied in a low-intensity wave treatment and a no-wave control. Depending on fish type, somatic growth was either reduced by up to 60{\%} or increased by up to 50{\%} following exposure to the wave treatment. Somatic growth and otolith daily increment width (ODIW), the latter being used as a proxy for the fish energy turnover, were compared to reveal the effects of waves on the energy budget of the fish. Three different reaction types to waves, which correlated to the body morphology of the six fish groups, could be distinguished. Small and fusiform fish benefitted from low-intensity waves and showed higher somatic growth rates and greater ODIW in the wave treatment. In small, deep-bodied fish, growth and ODIW were reduced by waves. Finally, in larger fish with either a fusiform or deep-bodied shape, ODIW was decoupled from somatic growth, with larger ODIW in waves, but reduced somatic growth. These results show that low-intensity hydrodynamic stress is a much more important and complex habitat factor than previously assumed. It is concluded that hydrodynamic stress by waves should be accounted for in bioenergetic models and studies on habitat choice in littoral fish species.},

abstract = {The major fisheries on the Pacific coast of Canada can be grouped into 12 species that have consistently represented about 80-90{\%} of the total catch from the past to the present. A review of population dynamics of these species indicates that climate and the ocean environment have a major impact on their productivity. We review the history of Canada's Pacific coast fishery to show that trends in catch were similar to trends in the climate and ocean environment. Decadal scale patterns in climate and the ocean are termed regimes and we show that it is the regime scale of climate variability that most influences the long-term trends in the catches in these major fisheries. Ignoring the impacts of regime shifts on the abundance trends in the future could result in collapses of major fisheries. The difficulty of knowing when a regime shift will occur may be overcome as we discover more about the mechanisms that affect the decadal-scale trends in the rotational velocity of the solid earth which is measured as the length of day (LOD).

abstract = {ABSTRACT: The effects of environmental change on the biodiversity, structure and functioning of marine ecosystems is still poorly understood. In fact, very few studies have focused on changes in the at-sea foraging tactics of pelagic seabirds in relation to environmental stochasticity. Aiming at filling this knowledge gap, from 2005 to 2010 we directly measured the influence of climate (as driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation phenomenon) on (1) marine productivity (i.e. chlorophyll a concentration), (2) fish prey abundances and (3) the foraging behaviour of a top marine predator, the Corys shearwater Calonectris diomedea borealis. There was a dramatic change in the foraging strategy of the birds during 2010, which seems to be mostly related to a climatic event that occurred during the winter of 2009 to 2010. This event had a negative impact on the productivity of the surroundings of the breeding colony and decreased the abundance of pelagic prey fish, which in turn altered the spatial, feeding and trophic ecology of Corys shearwater and decreased their reproductive success. However, the negative trend in the abundance of pelagic prey (estimated from acoustic surveys and commercial fisheries landings) may be of concern because it does not seem to be only related to the climatic event of 2010. Long-term monitoring of the interactions between top predators, their prey and lower strata of the food web is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of the impacts that environmental variation may have on coastal ecosystems worldwide.},

@article{Castro2000,
abstract = {For fish populations occurring in coastal upwelling areas, the timing of spawning has been proposed to occur during seasons when transport offshore is reduced. Along the coastal zone off central Chile, the anchoveta Engraulis ringens spawns preferentially during winter. Spawning in this season, however might represent a period of increased risk to eggs and larvae due to the harsh and variable oceanographic conditions. This study determined the mortality rates of egg and larval anchoveta in an area located close to the species' southern limit of distribution during its winter spawning season. Two temporal scales of variability, interseasonal (between years), and intraseasonal (individual daily cohort mortality rates) show that (1) mean seasonal mortality rates were not different between years and (2) mortality rates considering the egg and larval stages together (96{\%} daily in 1995 and 98{\%} daily in 1996) were much higher than those estimated using only the larval stage (4.4{\%} daily in 1995 and 6.8{\%} daily in 1996). The results of the individual cohort mortality rates, especially in 19{\$}5, revealed a tendency toward a decrease in mortality rates as the winter season progressed (from 52 to 9{\%} daily). Because the maximum egg abundance in the water column occurred early in the season in 1995, we propose that the largest fraction of the mean seasonal mortality was due to egg mortality occurring early in winter. The information on the environmental characteristics and the reported larval growth rates in different periods during the winter spawning season do not support the hypothesis of larval food limitation but, instead, suggest that oceanographic factors (e.g., cross-shelf transport, low water temperature, presence of river plumes) play a major role in the development and success of the early life stages in this southern spawning area.},

Anchovy eggs and larvae were found all year round, but they were much more abundant in spring and summer. In spring, the main spawning area was located in the north of the Gulf, to the west and southwest of Zembra Island. In summer, higher egg and larva abundances were also observed to the southwest of Zembra Island, but secondary spawning grounds were detected in the vicinity of the mouths of the Rivers Majreda and Meliane. No direct correlations between sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and chlorophyll a and the horizontal distribution of eggs and larvae were observed. However, egg distributions in all seasons and larval distributions in summer and autumn were significantly related to depth. The temporal variation of temperature seems to control the spawning intensity and the beginning of spawning seems to be triggered by the increase in SST.},

Measurements of ex situ target strength (TS; dB re 1 m(2)) were made on live anchovy using 38, 120, and 200 kHz split-beam echosounders. The fish were tethered using small hooks attached to their mouths. During the acoustic measurements, an underwater video camera was used to continuously monitor fish behaviour and tilt-angle (theta). Data for 35 individual anchovy ranging from immature to adult sizes (total lengths L(T) = 4.8-12.2 cm) were analysed. Least-squares regression fits of TS vs. log(L(T)) were: TS(38 kHz) = 20 log(L(T)) - 65.8 (r(2) = 0.82), TS(120 kHz) = 20 log(L(T)) - 68.4 (r(2) = 0.84), and TS(200 kHz) = 20 log(L(T)) - 69.1 (r(2) = 0.71). The LT vs. wet weight (W; g) relationship for these fish was W = 0.0036 L(T)(3.204). The mean theta for anchovy swimming freely in a large seawater tank was 9.1 degrees (s.d. = 13.1 degrees). These ex situ measurements of TS, L(T), W, and theta can be applied to improve acoustic estimates of Japanese anchovy biomass.},

Motility percentages of sperms incubated in ME(2)SO were significantly bigger than that observed in others three cryoprotectants. In the second stage, the optimal freezing rates were determinate, using ME 2 SO only. In this case, the biggest motility percentages were obtained with 1.5 M ME(2)SO with freezing rates of -20 to -40 degrees C min(-1) (61.3 +/- 7.6{\%} and 53.8 +/- 4.9{\%} respectively). Finally, the effect of addition of not permeable cryoprotectant in cryoprotective solution (egg hen yolk, VHG) was evaluated to optimize the post-thawing spermatic motility; nevertheless, the results did not change significantly respect to control without VHG.},

Each index assesses a different aspect of aggregation: the concentration, the percent occupancy of space and the clustering of high-fish abundance. Both time-series correlation and tree-based clustering-regression method, classification and regression trees (CART), were used to relate each of the indexes to environmental variables (season, temperature anomaly and year). Additionally, a measure of onshore-offshore distribution, the average distance from the coast, and abundance variables (the average acoustic backscatter per occupied sampling unit, and the acoustically estimated total abundance of sardine and anchovy from IMARPE) were related to environmental factors by using CART. We show that the 1983-2003 time series can be divided into three different periods: with shifts in 1992 and in 1997-98. Sardine and anchovy showed large differences in both abundance and aggregation among these periods. Although upwelling ecosystems support dramatic and sudden changes in environmental conditions, fish responses are sometimes smoother than usually suggested and there are transition periods with concomitant high biomasses of anchovy and sardine, but with different spatial aggregation patterns. Observed relationships between environmental proxies and aggregation patterns support the habitat-based hypothesis that environmentally mediated alterations in range lead to population changes.},

Hatch dates and growth rates for larval and juvenile survivors were estimated through otolith analysis. Water temperature and food availability were monitored on the spawning and nursery grounds in the inner part of the bay. The number of spawning females caught in nets set around the spawning ground was recorded during each spawning season (January to May) in 2000-2003. No correlation was found between the number of spawning females and the abundance of larvae and juveniles on the spawning and nursery grounds. The hatch dates of surviving larvae and juveniles were concentrated at the end of the spawning season in 2001 and in the middle of the season in 2003. The larvae experienced relatively high prey concentrations during the first-feeding period in 2001 but low concentrations in 2003. Survival of larvae during the first-feeding period may be a function of prey concentration as well as water temperature. In 2003, low water temperature would reduce starvation mortality during the first-feeding period. In contrast, unfavourable feeding conditions with higher temperatures during the first-feeding period seemed to result in low larval survival in 2000 and 2002. The 2001 larvae grew faster than those in 2003 because of the late hatch dates and the higher ambient temperatures that resulted. Temperature might be a major factor controlling growth rates of C. pallasii larvae in Miyako Bay.},

Anchovy larvae from the spawning area in the Gironde River plume are advected towards off-shelf waters, where juveniles are commonly observed. Otolith microstructural and chemical analysis were combined to assess the importance of this off-shelf transport and to determine the relative contribution of these areas for anchovy survival. Chemical analysis of otoliths showed that anchovy juveniles in the Bay of Biscay can be divided into two groups: a group that drifts towards off-shelf waters early in their life and returns later, and a group that remains in the low salinity waters of the coastal area. The first group presents significantly faster growth rates (0.88 mm day-1) than those remaining in the coastal waters (0.32 mm day-1). This may be due to off-shelf waters being warmer in spring/summer, and to the fact that the lower food concentration is compensated for by higher prey visibility. Furthermore, the group of juveniles that drifted off the spawning area and had faster growth rates represents 99{\%} of the juvenile population. These findings support the hypothesis that anchovy in the Bay of Biscay may use off-shelf waters as a spatio-temporal loophole, suggesting that transport off the shelf may be favourable for recruitment.},

@article{Frederiksen2006,
abstract = {1. Abundant mid-trophic pelagic fish often play a central role in marine ecosystems, both as links between zooplankton and top predators and as important fishery targets. In the North Sea, the lesser sandeel occupies this position, being the main prey of many bird, mammal and fish predators and the target of a major industrial fishery. However, since 2003, sandeel landings have decreased by {\textgreater} 50{\%}, and many sandeel-dependent seabirds experienced breeding failures in 2004. 2. Despite the major economic implications, current understanding of the regulation of key constituents of this ecosystem is poor. Sandeel abundance may be regulated 'bottom-up' by food abundance, often thought to be under climatic control, or 'top-down' by natural or fishery predation. We tested predictions from these two hypotheses by combining unique long-term data sets (1973-2003) on seabird breeding productivity from the Isle of May, SE Scotland, and plankton and fish larvae from the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We also tested whether seabird breeding productivity was more tightly linked to sandeel biomass or quality (size) of individual fish. 3. The biomass of larval sandeels increased two- to threefold over the study period and was positively associated with proxies of the abundance of their plankton prey. Breeding productivity of four seabirds bringing multiple prey items to their offspring was positively related to sandeel larval biomass with a 1-year lag, indicating dependence on 1-year-old fish, but in one species bringing individual fish it was strongly associated with the size of adult sandeels. 4. These links are consistent with bottom-up ecosystem regulation and, with evidence from previous studies, indicate how climate-driven changes in plankton communities can affect top predators and potentially human fisheries through the dynamics of key mid-trophic fish. However, the failing recruitment to adult sandeel stocks and the exceptionally low seabird breeding productivity in 2004 were not associated with low sandeel larval biomass in 2003, so other mechanisms (e.g. predation, lack of suitable food after metamorphosis) must have been important in this case. Understanding ecosystem regulation is extremely important for predicting the fate of keystone species, such as sandeels, and their predators.},

The effects of female size (length and weight), batch fecundity and mean sea surface temperature on oocyte size were also examined. Results showed larger oocytes and lower batch fecundity in females from the southern area. Oocyte volume differences persisted inter-annually and were not explained by differences in female sizes. Since ovary weight was similar between areas, the cost of producing larger oocytes in the south population seems to be a fecundity reduction. The latitudinal variations in oocyte number and size seem to be determined by the predominant environmental conditions in each habitat. Hence, female E. ringens seem to adapt their reproductive tactics by producing eggs sizes and quantities that favour survival of their offspring under the environmental conditions in which they are to develop.},

abstract = {P{\textgreater}Growth and longevity were studied for three species of the family scaridae, the longnose parrotfish (Hipposcarus harid), rusty parrotfish (Scarus ferrugineus) and bullethead parrotfish (Chlorurus sordidus), sampled at the eastern coast of the Red Sea, off Saudi Arabia. The three species are protogynous hermaphrodites presenting two distinct phases whereby the initial phase includes females and primary males, and the terminal phase is exclusively secondary males transformed from females. Annual marks in the ctenoid scales from the three species were used to develop size-at-age plots. Linear relationships were found between the scale radius and standard length for the three species, and the relationships between body weight (w) and standard length (L) were estimated. Scales of these species increased in size consistently throughout life, even though the somatic growth rate decreased with age. Sex-specific growth effects in the three species were demonstrated. Growth of initial phase females was the lowest, followed by the initial phase males and terminal phase males, the latter showing the fastest growth rates. Thus, transition to the terminal male identity was associated with enhanced growth, resulting in larger terminal males than females of equivalent size. The von Bertalanffy growth formula (VBGF) was estimated for H. harid, S. ferrugineus and C. sordidus (L-infinity = 43.92, 27.4 and 23.3; K = 0.067, 0.27 and 0.56; t(0) = -6.92, -4.98 and -4.6, respectively). The relationship between growth and reproduction of these species is also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper examines the hypotheses (1) that Sardinops sagax and Engraulis australis are spatially segregated and do not interact directly, and (2) that recent mass mortalities of S. sagax have facilitated an expansion in the distribution and abundance of E. australis. In South Australian waters, S, sagax and E. australis both spawn during summer and autumn. Eggs and larvae of both species occur over the continental shelf, and are abundant in areas where upwelling occurs (e.g, off the Coffin Bay Peninsula and the western tip of Kangaroo Island) and frontal systems form (e.g. in Investigator Strait and the entrance of Spencer Gulf). Alter the mass mortality events in 1995 and 1998, eggs and larvae of S. sagax were confined mainly to these areas, and estimates of the total abundance of S. sagax eggs and larvae in South Australian waters fell by between 48 and 83{\%} respectively. Between 1996 and 1999, densities of E. australis eggs and larvae increased in both key spawning areas and the central and eastern Great Australian Bight, and total abundance of eggs and larvae increased by over 215 and 285{\%} respectively. These results indicate that (1) S. sagax and E. australis are not spatially segregated and may interact directly, and (2) the mass mortalities of S. sagax may have facilitated an expansion in the distribution and abundance of E. australis. Hence, fluctuations in the relative abundance of S. sagax and Engraulis spp. observed in the world's productive boundary current systems may also be possible in Australian waters.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work is to present a conceptual model for fish otolith growth in which somatic growth is related to otolith growth and opacity. The model is based on known mechanisms of CaCO3 and protein incorporation into the otolith. Model parameters were derived from laboratory experiments and from the literature. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model was robust to measurement errors in most input parameters. The most sensitive parameters were the exponents of the otolith length-weight and otolith protein - whole-body protein synthesis relationships and the proportionality constant between metabolism and otolith growth rate. Application to experimental data resulted in good agreement between back-calculated and observed fish sizes. In the growth experiment, the average back-calculated weights were slightly lower than the average observed weights, but the correlation was highly significant. In the starvation experiment, the back-calculated weights were also highly correlated with observed weights, with slightly declining residuals with fish size. Unlike previous back-calculation methods, this model has the ability to detect periods of starvation and estimate growth histories in both growing and starving fish.},

abstract = {Early life stages of Engraulis ringens were reared from hatch until yolk exhaustion. We evaluated the effect of temperature on characteristics such as larval length and yolk volume at hatch, larval length at yolk absorption, duration of yolk-sac stage, yolk consumption rate and larval growth rate. Further, we determined the potential differences in these traits between populations located 13 degrees of latitude apart (Antofagasta 23 degrees S, Talcahuano 36 degrees S). The results showed that egg size had an effect on the larval length at hatch, initial yolk volume and larval length at yolk absorption, since the values obtained were always larger in larvae hatched from Talcahuano (from larger eggs) than from Antofagasta (smaller eggs). These characteristics were also modified by the rearing temperature. Duration of yolk-sac phase, yolk consumption rate and larval growth rate until yolk exhaustion showed high thermic dependence in both populations. However, these traits showed no difference between populations when larvae were reared at the same temperature in the range between 12 and 20 degrees C, despite their initial difference in egg size. When extrapolated from the environmental conditions in each nursery area (i.e. 15 degrees C Antofagasta and 12 degrees C Talcahuano), our results suggest that the anchoveta populations from Talcahuano compensate for their lower larval growth rates by increasing their initial egg and hatch sizes, as they are larger than Antofagasta larvae at the end of the yolk-sac stage. This increased larval length should enhance their chances of survival under adverse environmental conditions, such as high turbulence, lower temperature and lower food availability during winter, which is typical of the anchoveta southern spawning area.},

abstract = {The abundances and distributions of coastal pelagic fish species in the California Current Ecosystem from San Diego to southern Vancouver Island, were estimated from combined acoustic and trawl surveys conducted in the spring of 2006, 2008, and 2010. Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus), and Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus) were the dominant coastal pelagic fish species, in that order. Northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) were sampled only sporadically and therefore estimates for these species were unreliable. The estimates of sardine biomass compared well with those of the annual assessments and confirmed a declining trajectory of the "northern stock" since 2006. During the sampling period, the biomass of jack mackerel was stable or increasing, and that of Pacific mackerel was low and variable. The uncertainties in these estimates are mostly the result of spatial patchiness which increased from sardine to mackerels to anchovy and herring. Future surveys of coastal pelagic fish species in the California Current Ecosystem should benefit from adaptive sampling based on modeled habitat; increased echosounder and trawl sampling, particularly for the most patchy and nearshore species; and directed-trawl sampling for improved species identification and estimations of their acoustic target strength.},

abstract = {Three oceanographic surveys carried out in the Sicilian Channel during the spawning season (June to July) of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) showed a close relationship between anchovy reproductive strategy and important hydrographic structures. A time series of satellite-derived sea surface temperature images of the Sicilian Channel were analysed by means of empirical orthogonal functions and the dominant empirical modes were studied in detail. The first empirical mode captured much of the original variance and reproduced the trajectory of the Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS), the principal hydrodynamic feature of the area. The time coefficients of modes 1 and 2 had seasonal signals which, when combined, accounted for the enhancement of the thermal front, clearly visible off Cape Passero (southernmost coast of Sicily) during summer. As the area constituted the principal nursery ground of the Sicilian Channel anchovy, the combination of the time coefficients of these modes was considered a potential indicator of the food particle concentration usually associated with oceanic fronts, which provided the energy requirements for larval growth. Mode 3 described the north/south displacements of the mean AIS trajectory, which modified the surface temperature regime of the anchovy spawning habitat. Therefore, the time coefficients of this mode were used as a potential indicator of anchovy spawning habitat variability. The capability of time coefficients of modes 2 and 3 to modify the main pattern depicted by mode 1 were tested successfully against in situ oceanographic observations.},

abstract = {We developed a relatively simple and parsimonious (SMPAR) biomass dynamics model for estimating abundance of northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, off southern California and Baja California, Mexico, during the 1963 to 1991 fishing seasons. The SMPAR model was a compromise between simple surplus production and complex age-structured models. It was designed to give more precise biomass estimates for management of northern anchovy for which there are no age-composition data and only noisy abundance index data. We evaluated consistent bias in biomass and recruitment estimates, bias in recruitment estimates due to log transformation, and retrospective bias. Simple corrections based on bootstrap procedures were used to remove consistent bias and log transformation bias. Retrospective bias was not a significant problem. Results indicate that the SMPAR model estimates stock biomass more reliably than recruitment because abundance indices for northern anchovy contain little information about interannual recruitment variability. Asymptotic variance estimates calculated by inverting the Hessian matrix averaged 20{\%} smaller than variances calculated by bootstrapping. Outliers in abundance data were the biggest source of uncertainty in biomass estimates. Simulation results indicate that our approach could be useful in a variety of situations.},

The growth trajectories of individual larvae and early juveniles were backcalculated using the biological intercept method based on the allometric relationship between otolith radius and somatic length. Mean larval growth rates ranged from 0.49 to 0.71 mm day(-1) in the transition region, and were comparable to those reported from the Pacific coastal waters of central Japan, which is the principal distribution range of E. japonicus. In terms of growth, the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region seemed to be a favourable nursery area for larval E. japonicus. Larval growth tended to decline from the inshore to the offshore waters in the transition region. Thermal conditions did not show an inshore-offshore trend in the survey area and did not explain the longitudinal trend in growth rates.},

Brining with plant extracts slowed down the lipid oxidation of anchovies. The highest antioxidant effect was observed in brined anchovies with rosemary and myrtle extracts during storage as indicated by peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and oxidative rancidity (OR) scores. Furthermore, OR scores in brined anchovies were well correlated with thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (r(2) = 0.66, P {\textless} 0.01) and POV (r(2) = 0.87; P {\textless} 0.01). The fatty acid profiles were similar among the brined anchovies with plant extracts.

Growth increments were counted on otoliths using a microscope. Daily growth increments were tentatively validated relating an index of increment formation with time of the day. The Laird-Gompertz model was adjusted to the data, and the function of the instantaneous growth rate over length was compared to anchovy caught off Uruguay (35 degrees S) and Argentina (43 degrees to 44 degrees S). Differences for the model parameters between the three sampling locations seem to be related to temperature. Off Cape Santa Marta Grande, the site of an undersurface upwelling, water column conditions are warm, unstable and wind-dependent, while off Peninsula Valdez (Argentina), the site of a tidal front, waters are cooler and more stable. Off Uruguay, characterised by an haline front, the Laird-Gompertz model parameters are intermediate.},

For reasonable choices of model parameters, solutions exhibit two types of oscillation, an ENSO-like interannual mode and a decadal one. The decadal mode affects the equatorial zone by means of an oceanic teleconnection that involves transport variations of the North Pacific Subtropical Cell. Since almost half of the cool, thermocline water that upwells in the eastern equatorial Pacific participates ill this cell, these variations significantly alter the extent of the cold tongue, and hence provide an efficient mechanism for modulating ENSO.},

The abundance of the yolksac larvae positively correlated with the abundance of eggs, but the abundance of recruits did not significantly correlate with the abundance of yolksac larvae. These results imply that the survival rate during the egg stage is relatively stable, but that the rate during the larval stage is variable. Of the three most recent decades (1980s, 1990s and 2000s), the abundance of recruits was highest in the 1980s. The decrease in the abundance of recruits after the 1990s can be considered to have occurred through a decline in survival rate during the larval stage because there were no significant differences in egg abundance, yolksac larval abundance, and survival rates during the egg stage in the three decades of the study period.},

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms controlling recruitment in fishes is a major problem in fisheries science. Although the literature on recruitment mechanisms is large and growing rapidly, it is primarily species specific. There is no conceptual framework to integrate the existing information on larval fish ecology and its relationship to survival and recruitment. In this paper, we propose an integrating framework based on body size. Although all larval fish are small relative to adult fish, total length at hatching differs among species by an order of magnitude. As many of the factors critical to larval survival and growth are size dependent, substantially different expectations arise about which mechanisms might be most important to recruitment success. We examined the evidence for the importance of size to feeding and starvation, to activity and searching ability, and to risk of predation. Regressions based on data from 72 species of marine and freshwater species suggest that body size is an important factor that unifies many of the published observations. A conceptual framework based on body size has the potential to provide a useful integration of the available data on larval growth and survival and a focus for future studies of recruitment dynamics.},

abstract = {The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has been described by some as a long-lived El Nino-like pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes having distinct spatial and temporal characteristics of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: "cool" PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924 and again from 1947-1976, while "warm" PDO regimes dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations-at a range of varying time scales-can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities-one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years-the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.},

We used a longitudinal approach by repeatedly measuring marked fish and obtaining corresponding otolith radius measurements. Differential energy allocation of mature males did not affect the proportionality ratio between otolith and somatic size. Short-term otolith growth varied with short-term somatic growth, but only weakly with temperature. Some correlation coefficients of the covariation of otolith growth estimated over a longer time interval with somatic growth were significantly greater than the short-term estimate. For mature and immature males, back-calculated lengths accurately estimated the observed individual length on practically all occasions. These results indicate that back-calculation can be used to estimate size for Atlantic salmon with different energy allocation patterns. Variable strength of coupling of otolith and somatic growth depending on time interval suggests that these processes are completed on different time scales.},

Historical forecasts from a skillful prediction model together with a series of ensemble predictions from a "perfect model" experiment are used to demonstrate that these arguments carry over to the practical prediction situation. In such a setting it is found that the amplitude of the dominant normal mode, which strongly resembles the observed ENSO cycle, is a potentially useful index of reliability. The fact that this index was generally lower in the 1970s than the 1980s provides an explanation for why many coupled models performed better in the latter decade. It does not, however, explain the low skill of some coupled models in the early 1990s as the index defined here was then moderate.},

The physical mechanisms responsible for these fluctuations are poorly understood. Some theories ascribe a central role to the wind-driven meridional overturning circulation between the tropical and subtropical oceans. Here we show, from observations over the past 50 years, that this overturning circulation has been slowing down since the 1970s, causing a decrease in upwelling of about 25{\%} in an equatorial strip between 9 degreesN and 9 degreesS. This reduction in equatorial upwelling of relatively cool water, from 47 x 10(6) to 35 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1), is associated with a rise in equatorial sea surface temperatures of about 0.8 degreesC. Another effect of the slowing circulation is a reduction in the outgassing of CO(2) from the equatorial Pacific Ocean-at present the largest oceanic source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Hogfish, Lachnolaimus maximus (Walbaum), have multiple traits that confound measuring reproductive potential: they are protogynous, relatively long-lived harem-forming fish that spawn daily for months. Additionally, recent evidence demonstrates that size, age and timing of sex change vary on a spatial scale within the study area (West Florida shelf, USA). This study investigates the effect of this spatial variation on hogfish reproductive potential by evaluating spawning seasonality, spawning frequency and batch fecundity using an indeterminate egg production model. Offshore females were larger than nearshore females, and batch fecundity was related in a log-linear manner to female size. Gonad histology demonstrated a more protracted reproductive period for females offshore (8 months) than nearshore (4 months). Spatial variations in size coincide with ontogeny because hogfish move offshore with growth; however, even after accounting for fish size, offshore females spawned more. In areas where male removal rates are elevated, spawning harems are disrupted; thus, greater fishing effort nearshore may further reduce the reproductive potential of these females. These nearshore and offshore spawning components of the population are not genetically distinct, but instead represent two contingent spawning strategies that likely enhance total population stability and resilience of this stock in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.},

abstract = {Heterochrony, an evolutionary change in developmental processes, is one of the major proximate causes of morphological diversity of organisms. It has been reported in the medaka Oryzias latipes that higher-latitude larvae have a genetic tendency to complete fin ray formation at larger body sizes, which results in relatively shorter anal and dorsal fins in adults. However, this latitudinal, heterochronic variation in fin length in the wild may be partially explained by latitudinal differences in thermal environments, if temperatures affect the timing of fin ray formation. Common-environment experiments revealed that the body size at which fin pterygiophore (a basal skeleton of fin rays) formation was completed was larger in higher-latitude larvae than in lower-latitude larvae at all temperatures examined, supporting the proposal that fin ray formation of the former is genetically delayed. However, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature was also evident; lower temperatures caused delayed fin ray formation until a larger body size had been achieved in both high- and low-latitude larvae. These observations suggest that habitat temperatures also contribute to the latitudinal difference in the timing of fin development, magnifying phenotypic variation in fin length across latitudes. We discuss reasons for this positive covariance between genetic and environmental effects on the latitudinal, heterochronic variation, from the viewpoint of local adaptation and evolution of phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {Aim Similar regimes of selection in different geographical settings can deterministically produce similar adaptive morphologies. We tested the hypothesis that the evolutionary trajectories of fish in upwelling zones can be altered by biogeographic contingencies in the biological and physical environment. Location Eastern Pacific and western Atlantic oceans. Methods We estimated phylogenetic relationships among eastern Pacific temperate anchovies (genus Engraulis) and tropical anchovies (genus Cetengraulis) with neighbour-joining and Bayesian tree analysis of a 521-bp segment of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b. Available sequences for five additional engraulid taxa were included to establish polarity of the tree. Bayesian estimates (BEAST) of time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the nodes in the phylogeny were calibrated with divergence between Cetengraulis edentulus and Cetengraulis mysticetus precipitated by the rise of the Panama Isthmus 2.8-3.2 Ma. Results Neighbour-joining and Bayesian trees indicate that South American Engraulis anchoita (Argentina) and Engraulis ringens (Chile) together are basal sister taxa to the California anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Old World anchovies (Engraulis japonicas, Engraulis australis, Engraulis capensis and Engraulis encrasicolus). The two tropical species of Cetengraulis are sister-taxa to Californian E. mordax, even though their phenotypes and ecologies differ markedly. A relaxed molecular clock indicates a TMRCA between Californian E. mordax and Cetengraulis at about 4.2 Ma (3.0-6.3 Ma 95{\%} highest probability density). Main conclusions The TMRCA between the California anchovy, E. mordax, and tropical Cetengraulis coincides with the formation of the Gulf of California, which provided opportunities for allopatric isolation during climate oscillations. Mid-Pliocene warming (3.1-2.9 Ma) may have trapped ancestors of Cetengraulis in the Gulf of California, where they evolved digestive tract morphologies to exploit inshore tropical habitats with low plankton productivities. While populations of several other temperate fishes have become isolated in the Gulf of California, few of these derived species show strong adaptive shifts from temperate sister taxa or range expansions into the tropical provinces of the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific.},

abstract = {For many fish species, growth and mortality of larvae are closely coupled, with faster-growing larvae generally experiencing higher survivorship in the plankton, which may lead to higher recruitment. Using back-calculated growth trajectories derived from otolith increments we used the modified Fry model to estimate the growth rate of larvae and early juveniles of the commercially important sparid, Chrysophrys auratus, at four sites around northern New Zealand. Back-calculated growth rates were used to test the hypothesis that fish with a short pelagic larval duration ({\textless}= 20 days) grew faster than did fish with a long pelagic larval duration ({\textgreater} 24 days) during both the larval and juvenile periods. At three of the four sites, fish with a short larval duration grew significantly faster during the larval period, and these larvae generally continued to have a larger size-at-age as juveniles up to 70-day-old. Growth rates for both the larval and early juvenile period were also found to vary significantly among the four sites and were found to be unrelated to differences in water temperature. Localised variation in early growth of C. auratus among sites may be important in helping explain differences in their contribution to the recruitment to C. auratus populations.},

abstract = {The world's largest mono-specific fishery, the Peruvian anchovy or anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery, has been the subject of many studies since the 1960s. Details of its relationship with other species have mainly focused on alternations with sardine, Sardinops sagax, and little effort has so far been paid to interactions with other species sharing the same ecosystem. This is the case for Pleuroncodes monodon, the crustacean squat lobster or 'munida', which has become highly abundant along the Peruvian coast since the mid-1990s. Munida is now an important prey for seabirds, mammals and coastal predatory fish. Knowledge of patterns of distribution and ecological niche of munida is scarce however off Peru. Here we describe and compare spatial patterns of distribution of anchoveta and munida and their ecological niches based on data from 26 acoustic surveys performed along the Peruvian coast between 1998 and 2006. The results indicate that munida and anchoveta share ecological niches but that munida is restricted to the coldest part of the productive cold coastal waters whereas anchoveta do not present any temperature preference over a large range (14-23 degrees C). The recent increase in munida abundance off Peru is concomitant with colder conditions; with their onset munida extended its range from central Chile northwards. Off Peru the very shallow oxycline keeps munida from its usual bottom habitat and has forced it to adopt pelagic behaviour. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3) are products of the thyroid gland in all vertebrates. Their role in early development and metamorphosis is well established in mammals and amphibians, respectively, and recently several studies in fish have highlighted the importance of THs during flatfish metamorphosis. THs are present in high quantities in fish eggs and are presumably of maternal origin. During embryogenesis the concentration of T-4 and T-3 in the eggs decrease until endogenous production starts. Thyroid hormone receptors (TR) have been isolated from several teleosts and in common with tetrapods two receptor isoforms have been identified, TR alpha and TR beta. Both the receptors are expressed in early embryos and larvae of the Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and seabream (Sparus aurata) although a different temporal pattern is apparent. The role of THs and TRs in fish embryogenesis, larval development and during metamorphosis will be discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The overwintering strategy is widespread among planktivorous fish from temperate to sub-polar regions, and is particularly pronounced in sandeel ecotypes. This adaptation is presumably a behavioural adaptation to strong seasonal fluctuation in prey availability, day length and temperature. Yet so far, insight into the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms involved has remained elusive. In the present study, the overwintering behaviour is considered to be a strategy requiring 2 annual decisions: When to end overwintering and when to start overwintering, which combined comprise the timing and duration of the foraging window. We present a model framework for sandeel that demonstrates how the optimal timing of the foraging window involves a trade-off between energy gain and survival probability. Physiological components of the model are based on laboratory experiments with sandeel, some of which are presented as part of this study. The major findings were that optimisation of individual fitness is strictly dependent on the temporal match between the foraging window and the peak period of the spring burst of zooplankton. In contrast, fitness is only marginally reduced in individuals that fail to optimise the foraging window in relation to the level of mortality and prey availability experienced during the zooplankton spring burst. Lastly, overwintering remained the optimal strategy, even in scenarios where winter prey abundances approached abundances near that of the peak abundance in spring.},

The instantaneous mortality rate (IMR) of embryonic stages decreased in spring and increased in summer, with a range of 0.33–1.23 day–1 in spring and 0.78–1.69 day–1 in summer. Egg production in summer was three times that during spring and production was low in the late 1980s. Mean lengths of yolk-sac larvae and adult females were greater in spring than in summer, whereas spawning fraction and spawning stock ratio (spawning biomass:adult biomass) were lower in spring than summer. Estimated mean spawning stock biomass ranged from 141 × 103 to 380 × 103 MT in spring and from 221 × 103 to 557 × 103 MT in summer. Statistically, the seasonal and long-term trends of embryonic mortality, egg production and spawning stock biomass of Pacific anchovy can be explained largely by spring warming, summer cooling and by less abundant zooplankton in the late 1980s.},

abstract = {Larval duration of a demersal fish is a product of its genotype, its larval environment and the capacity of the species to delay metamorphosis. Circumstantial evidence has led to the hypothesis that the lower age-limit for settlement is governed by the rate of larval development, while the upper age-limit is determined by the extent to which a delay of metamorphosis is possible. This study examined the capacity of a widely distributed reef fish, the manini Acanthurus triostegus, to extend its larval duration by delaying metamorphosis. Variation in larval duration was examined from 8 samples of manini collected in French Polynesia using crest nets over a 2 yr period. Variation in the overall age at colonisation determined from daily otolith increments was very low (CV 5.5 {\%}) given the pan-Pacific distribution pattern of the species. A field experiment was conducted to determine whether manini could delay metamorphosis. To enable its interpretation, the metamorphosis of the species was characterised morphologically. Metamorphosis involved a loss of transparency, a shortening of fin spines and a migration of the mouth from a terminal to ventral position over a 5 d period. To experimentally examine the capacity of the species to delay metamorphosis manini were caught at night as they colonised a reef and placed in 1 of 2 treatments: benthic cages in the shallow backreef, or fine monofilament cages suspended between 3 and 6 m in a 50 m water column on the outer reef slope. Fish in benthic cages completed metamorphosis within 5 d. In contrast, 24 {\%} of fish in pelagic cages (8 out of 34 fish) remained transparent (although some developed faint stripes) and retained the pelagic body shape. Fish that delayed metamorphosis still deposited a mark on their otoliths indistinguishable in structure from the settlement marks deposited on otoliths of their benthic-caged counterparts and reef-caught juveniles. This is the first experimental evidence that the settling stages of some demersal fish species can delay metamorphosis in the reef environment. As such it supports the conceptual model generally applied to the selective settlement of demersal fishes.},

abstract = {The Engraulis ringens distribution (4 to 42 degrees S) covers a wide variety of environmental conditions. We assessed the coping mechanisms used by this anchoveta in different spawning habitats, reporting differences in egg traits between populations off northern (Iquique, 20 degrees S) and southern Chile (Talcahuano, 36 degrees S) and throughout the spawning season. Eggs were smaller off Iquique, declined in size during the reproductive season (both populations), and inter-population differences persisted throughout the spawning season. Batch fecundity (eggs per batch per female) and relative fecundity (eggs per female weight) were lower off Talcahuano during the peak spawning months. Thus, larger eggs spawned in the southern population seem to be produced at the cost of a reduction in fecundity. The eggs also differed biochemically between the 2 populations; total lipids and triacylglycerides were much higher off Talcahuano. The biochemical composition (both populations) also changed throughout the spawning season, with higher lipids early in the spawning season (July to August) off Talcahuano. Hatching success decreased during the spawning season, and correlated positively with egg size and lipid contents. Environmental conditions differed markedly between spawning areas and from mid-winter to late spring. Off Talcahuano, the temperature and winter-time water column productivity are lower and turbulence is higher, while eggs are larger, lipid contents higher, and batch fecundity lower. This mechanism seems to facilitate survival of young offspring in the more adverse winter conditions off Talcahuano. These egg characteristics are determined by the adult female reproductive system, representing a maternal influence on the early life-history traits of anchoveta that might enable rapid changes in population densities in some years of improved habitat conditions.},

abstract = {Regimes of high abundance of sardine (Sardinops sagax and Sardina pilchardus) have alternated with regimes of high abundance of anchovy (Engraulis spp.) in each of the five regions of the world where these taxa co-occur and have been extensively fished. When one taxon has been plentiful, the other has usually been at a reduced level of abundance, and vice versa. Changes in the four heavily fished regions that support S. sagax–the Japanese, Californian, Humboldt, and Benguela systems–from a regime dominated by one taxon to a high level of abundance of the other have occurred more or less simultaneously. In the Pacific Ocean, sardines have tended to increase during periods of increasing global air and sea temperatures and anchovies to decrease. The Japanese system is dominated by sardines to a greater extent than the other systems, and sardines off Japan appear to increase as the Kuroshio Current cools. At the eastern edge of the Pacific Ocean, sardines colonize cooler areas during periods of warming. The Benguela system is out of phase with the three Pacific systems. The four systems all appeared to be in a state of flux in the 1980s. Increased abundance of the subdominant taxon is often one of the first signs of change. Sardines are relatively sedentary in refuge areas when scarce but change behavior to become highly migratory and colonize cooler areas when abundant. Anchovies, by contrast, expand around a fixed geographic center.},

Otolith microstructure analysis was conducted on specimens ranging from 10 to 60 mm TL, including the transition from larval to juvenile stages (i.e. at metamorphosis). Fish were aged by growth increment counts on sagittal otoliths, presuming they were laid down with a daily periodicity. Age estimates ranged from 16 to 96 days, with a good consistency between readings. The hatch date distribution, back-calculated from the date of capture, was spread over a long period (April-February), with three main cohorts hatched in May, August and November. The instantaneous growth rate, calculated for the whole fish sample, was 0.68 mm/day. Nevertheless, the growth rate estimated for each of the main cohorts showed a seasonal trend, being higher in May and decreasing in August and November. The allometric relationship between otolith and fish size changed markedly during the transition from larval to juvenile stages, with a slight decrease of otolith growth rate after metamorphosis. The instantaneous total mortality rates of anchovy, calculated for each of the main cohorts, was lower in May and progressively increased in August and November cohorts, showing an opposite seasonal trend respect to the growth rate.

Anchovies (Engraulis spp.) utilise a range of behavioural strategies to increase egg and larval survival. Ontogenetic shifts in distribution have been proposed for Australian anchovy (Engraulis australis), but no supporting otolith-based age studies have been published to date. The present study used otolith increment counts to age larval, juvenile and adult Australian anchovy, which spawn throughout South Australian gulf and shelf waters. Only fish up to 1 year of age occurred in the northern Spencer Gulf, where eggs and larvae in high densities are retained in a nursery area favourable to anchovies. The southern gulf area was inhabited by 1, 2 and 3 year olds. Older anchovy were found in offshore shelf waters, where upwelling occurs and larval survivorship may be high. We hypothesise that Australian anchovy move offshore with age to utilise the wide range of environments that provide suitable spawning and nursery areas for this species.},

The estimated fish lengths corresponded well to observed fish lengths for simple traditional (SPH, BPH, and Fraser-Lee) and the new models. However, the back-calculated growth rates did not correspond to observed growth rates except for the new model. All previous models had considerable bias; growth rates of slow-growing fish were overestimated. As our model incorporating the age effect did not show such bias, this bias would be attributed to the age effect. Our proposed back-calculation model incorporating the age effect should be useful to estimate past growth rates at the individual level.},

abstract = {In the upwelling zone of the northeastern Pacific, cold nutrient-rich conditions alternate with warm nutrient-poor intervals on timescales ranging from months to millennia. In this setting, the abundances of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) fluctuate by several orders of magnitude, with sardine dominating during warm conditions and anchovy dominating during cool conditions. Two population models can explain the response of these fishes to adverse conditions. Under the basin model, species distributions contract to a central (optimal) range during population crashes. Expectations of this model may include a single range-wide population with a decline in genetic diversity on both sides of a central refuge. In contrast, the self-recruitment model invokes a series of local oceanographic domains that maintain semi-isolated subpopulations. During adverse conditions, some subpopulations cannot complete the life cycle within the local environment and are extirpated. Expectations of this model include some degree of population genetic structure and no clear gradient in genetic diversity. We examined mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b sequences to assess these competing models for anchovy (N = 196; 539 bp) and sardine (N = 107; 425 bp). The mitochondrial DNA gene genealogies are shallow but diverse for both species. Haplotype frequencies are homogeneous among subpopulations, but genetic diversities peak for both species along Baja California and adjacent southern California. Mismatch distributions and Tajima's D-values reveal distinctive signatures of population bottlenecks and expansions. Sardine haplotypes coalesce at similar to241 000 years BP, with an initial female effective population size N(f0) = 0 followed by exponential growth to N(f1) = 115 million. Anchovy haplotypes coalesce at similar to282 000 years BP, with an initial population size of N(f0) = 14 000, followed by exponential growth to N(f1) = 2.3 million. These results indicate a founder event for sardine and a severe population decline for anchovy in the California Current during the late Pleistocene. Overall, these data support the basin model on decadal timescales, although local recruitment may dominate on shorter timescales.},

abstract = {The development of the relationship between otolith and body size in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) between hatching and emergence was examined by repeatedly measuring individually identified fish. Otolith growth increments were deposited daily in the period between hatching and emergence. Comparison of back-calculated otolith size and standard length using least squares regression analyses revealed a weak relationship between these variables at each of the 5-day sampling intervals. However, when data sets were pooled among intervals, variation in otolith size accounted for 98{\%} of the variation in alevin length. A computer simulation demonstrated that levels of measurement error similar to those documented in our study resulted in the failure of regression analyses to detect strong relationships between otolith and fish size. Mortality that occurred during the experiment was strongly size selective. This truncated the size ranges of fish in cross-sectional data sets and thus reduced the ability of regression analysis to detect relationships between otolith and fish size. We propose that the weak relationship between otolith and fish size at emergence recorded in previous studies was an artifact of measurement error and the truncation of size ranges in regression analyses. Differences in alevin size at emergence were present at hatching and had been propagated by growth.},

abstract = {Fish scales accumulating in marine laminated sediments can provide a record of population variability of small pelagic fishes. Although some studies have noted signs of scale degradation that could affect estimates of population variability, there are presently no well-developed means to evaluate degradation. We developed several indices as indicators of fish scale preservation in two box-cores that we collected off Pisco (14 degrees S), one at 301 m near the center of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), and the other at 201 m near the upper limit of the OMZ. These indices include (1) an index of fish scale integrity (estimate of scale wholeness relative to fragmentation), (2) the fungi-free area of fish scales and vertebrae, (3) the ratio of fish scales to vertebrae (as well as fish scales to vertebrae and bones), and (4) the ratio of whole scales to fragments. We address whether lower numbers of anchovy scales occurring in association with reduced total organic carbon fluxes and higher bottom-water oxygen concentrations are due entirely to lower abundances of anchovy or whether differential preservation of the fish scales in the sediments plays an important role in reduced scale abundances. Comparison of temporal sequences between the two cores provides the means to assess whether there are differences in the preservation of fish scales. The combined indices indicate that the lower numbers of fish scales in the earliest period have been affected by degradation, and to a greater degree in the box-core from 201 meters, which can be subject to higher oxygen concentrations. On the other hand, decadal-scale variations in fish scale abundance within the period of better preservation are unlikely to be caused by degradation. We discuss the utility and drawbacks of different indices of preservation for reconstructing past changes in fish population sizes with fluxes of fish debris and also briefly discuss the utility of these indices to other paleobiological systems.},

Anchovy larvae begin feeding on prey items {\textgreater}150 mu m at smaller sizes than sardine larvae, and the diets of both species are based mainly on copepod nauplii and postnauplii. Seasonal differences in the composition of the plankton influenced the contributions of prey types to the diets of the two species, e.g. the cladoceran Evadne spp. in anchovy and the tintinnid Codonellopsis sp. in sardine. Although copepod eggs are generally present in the diets of larval clupeoids, they were not major components of the diets of the species considered here. Despite morphological similarity, selection patterns were different between the species and changed through ontogeny.},

The batch fecundity of Engraulis F can be expressed as a linear regression between the number of eggs and the ovary-free weight W-h*; the regression equation for hydrated females without newpostovulatory follicles collected during the fishing season was F = -186.7+448.4 W-h*; r(2) = 0.82. The relative fecundity (number of hydrated oocytes per gram from ovary-free females) of the 72 hydrated females was, however, 437.2 with a variance of 49.3 and a coefficient of variation of 1.60; this is compared with those of other Clupeiforms.},

The seasonal von Bertalanffy growth model and length frequency analysis methods were applied to estimate anchovy growth parameters L-infinity k, C and t(s) by the use of ELEFAN I and Powell-Wheterall methods. The mean parameter estimates were L-infinity=18.95 and k=0.90 per years by ELEFAN I and L-infinity=18.69 and k=0.90 per years by Powell-Wheterall method. Length-age keys were estimated and used to describe fishery trends. Length at one-year old was estimated to be between 11.14 and 11.31 cm.

abstract = {Specific trace elements incorporated into the growing surface of the fish otolith reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of the ambient water, although not necessarily in a simplistic manner. Since fish which spend at least part of their lives in different water masses often produce otoliths of different elemental composition, the otolith elemental composition ('elemental fingerprint') can serve as an environmentally induced tag of groups of fish. On the basis of isotope dilution ICPMS (ID-ICPMS) assays of nearly 2500 dissolved adult cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, it has become clear that cod otolith elemental fingerprints based on the elements Li, Mg, Mn, Sr and Ba are physically stable, reproducible and consistent between left and right otoliths. Highly significant differences existed among the fingerprints of all of the spawning aggregations, resulting in a characteristic marker for each aggregation. Long-term stability (4-13 years) of the fingerprints for a given spawning group was not evident, indicating that the fingerprint was not a proxy for genetic identity. However, the fingerprint was very stable over the shea-term (up to 1 year), suggesting that it could serve as a seasonally stable biological tracer, or natural tag, of pre-defined groups of fish, even during situations of extensive stock mixing. As an illustration of the tracer approach, a maximum likelihood-based stock mixture analysis was applied to feeding (summer) and over-wintering stock distributions, using the fingerprints of the spring spawning aggregations as known-stock reference samples. The results of the summer stock mixture analyses suggested that the mixture analysis was accurate within 1{\%}, while the stock mixture analysis of the over-wintering schools produced stock-specific distributions which would have been difficult to obtain using alternative approaches. While the use of elemental fingerprints as natural tags is not suited to all stock mixing situations, suitability can probably be determined beforehand on the basis of existing environmental and biological information.

In Experiment 1, red sea bream Pagrus major larvae were reared in two commercial seed production tanks. The survival rate in Tank 1 was higher than in Tank 2, even though phytoplankton, Nannochloropsis sp., was added to both tanks. In Tank 2, gamma-proteobacteria became dominant (similar to 70{\%} of total bacteria) on day 13, thereafter heavy larval mortalities occurred. In Tank 1, however, alpha-proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster were predominant from day -1 until day 13; no significant mortality was recorded. In Experiment 2, marble goby Oxyeleotris marmoratus larvae were cultured with or without Nannochloropsis sp. At the end of the experiment, larval survival rates in aquaria with Nannochloropsis sp. were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher than those without. In rearing water without Nannochloropsis sp., gamma-proteobacteria increased during rearing. In rearing water with Nannochloropsis sp., alpha-proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster were predominant at the beginning of the experiments and the relative abundance of gamma-proteobacteria was maintained at a lower level throughout the experiments. The predominance of alpha-proteobacteria and the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium cluster appears to be a good indicator of successful larval production.},

abstract = {Back-calculation of growth trajectories from otolith microstructure is a valuable tool for understanding mechanisms underlying variability in growth among fish populations. We analyzed fish length/otolith radius relationships for Snake River spring/summer Chinook and Snake River fall Chinook salmon, listed as separate "Evolutionarily Significant Units" (ESUs) under the US Endangered Species Act, to determine whether these ESUs shared relationships. In addition, we analyzed otoliths from seven separate populations within the Snake River spring/summer Chinook ESU to assess the variability in relationships among populations, which are much more closely related than ESUs. We also examined several potential functional forms for the equations. We found that the separate ESUs had significantly different fish length/otolith radius relationships, but that variability in otolith growth rate could not explain the difference. Relationships among populations within the spring/summer Chinook ESU did not vary nearly as much as those between ESUs. The quadratic model and the power model fit the data equally well, and constraining these models to pass through a biological intercept (estimated fish length and otolith radius at hatching) resulted in only a slight decrease in model fit. To test the ability of the models to back-calculate fish lengths, we predicted the length at tagging for 17 PIT-tagged fall Chinook that were measured at release and at recapture. The back-calculation demonstrated little bias ({\textless}1 mm FL, on average) and relatively small standard deviation (similar to 3.5 mm) for the best model. When we repeated the back-calculation with data from both ESUs combined, bias increased substantially (to 15 mm FL), demonstrating the importance of determining the proper taxonomic level at which to combine data within a species.},

The entire genome was purified by gene amplification using the long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, and products were subsequently used as templates for PCR with 56 fish-versatile primers that amplify contiguous, overlapping segments of the entire genome. Direct sequencing of the PCR products demonstrated that the genome (16 675 base pairs [bp]) contained the same 37 mitochondrial genes (two ribosomal RNA, 22 transfer RNA and 13 protein-coding genes) as those found in other vertebrates, with the gene order being identical to that in typical vertebrates. A major non-coding region between the tRNA(Pro) and tRNA(Phe) genes (1024 bp) was considered to be the control (D-loop) region, as it has several conservative blocks characteristic to this region.},

Stomach contents from the first cruise were dominated by Appendicularia and Copepoda and, to a lesser extent, bivalve postlarvae, anchovy eggs, Cladocera, Salpidae, Euphausiacea and Amphipoda. The stomach repletion stages used indicated that appendicularians were an important food for anchovy; appendicularians have never been previously mentioned in anchovy diet. North Patagonian anchovies contained mainly Copepoda and Cladocera along with Appendicularia, Euphausiacea, anchovy eggs and Amphipoda. For each survey, the abundance of appendicularians in both the plankton and stomach contents showed similar patterns. The only species of Appendicularia recorded was Oikopleura dioica. In plankton, 50{\%} of the animals were mature. However, in the stomachs they were all mature. Probably the anchovy has filtered on breeding aggregations of mature houseless individual grouped near the surface for spawning explaining the great number of non-digested individuals in the stomachs.},

It was shown that starving larvae (5 to 80{\%}) were mainly found in the smaller length classes (4 to 10 mm SL), but some larvae between 16 to 20 mm SL were also determined as starving (4 to 6{\%}). Larvae found in the stratified water column had higher RNA/DNA ratios reflecting a better nutritional condition than in the mixed water body. The degree of starvation at the same developmental stage was higher in Brazil than in the Argentinian area. RNA/DNA ratios of larvae from the Argentinian area showed a significant shift to higher values (indicating a better condition) than in Brazil. Results on the nutritional condition of the larvae based on RNA/DNA ratios were compared with zooplankton data and larval gut analyses determined on the same cruise.

abstract = {Hatchery reared juvenile rainbow trout of common parentage were reared on measured low or high rations, or fed ad libitum for 4.3 months to produce fish with different growth rates. Fish from the different groups differed in size by up to 40 and 290{\%} for length and weight, respectively, by the end of the trial. Slow somatic growth was not accompanied by correspondingly slow growth of either the eyes, optic tectum or the cerebellum, suggesting that above a certain maintenance ration, growth of these parts of the CNS is strongly age-dependent. Retinal characteristics were also found to be age-dependent and not affected by the somatic growth rate of the fish. The corollary that age-dependent ocular growth should also be reflected in different relative eye sizes in fish with differential growth rates in the wild was tested by comparing fish of known age from lakes in which fish have markedly different growth profiles. Fish stocked from a single hatchery were recaptured from Lakes Okataina and Tarawera (rapid fish growth) and Lake Taharoa (slow fish growth) at times up to 5 years after release. As predicted, eye sizes of fish from Lakes Okataina and Tarawera were smaller for any given body size, than those of fish from Lake Taharoa. Absolute eye size was correlated with fish age, although there was some variation in eye size for any given age. Taken together, these results show that up to a certain level of food deprivation, growth of the eye is maintained at the expense, or in spite, of low somatic growth. However, there is a level of somatic growth below which ocular growth is affected.},

abstract = {Microincrements in the lapilli otoliths of Lophius piscatorius L. were used to validate the age of fish {\textless}27 cm TL collected in spring and autumn. Contrary to published estimates of size at age based on illicia by Dupouy et al. (1986) and Duarte et al. (1997), these small specimens were found to be either 0- or 1-group. Comparison between the macrostructures of illicia and sagittae indicated that a translucent zone is formed in the illicia of most 0-group by autumn but not in sagittae. Hence, earlier estimates of small size at age may have arisen from incorrect interpretation of the time of first translucent zone formation in illicia. In addition to enabling age validation, microstructure provided a means of distinguishing between the translucent material that forms false rings and annuli. Annuli appeared as a sequence of gradually declining increment widths whereas false rings were characterized by ail abrupt check in otolith formation followed by increments similar in width to adjacent opaque material. The implications of these findings to age reading and interpretation are discussed. (C) 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Length-age relationship was approximated by Gompertz and Laird-Gompertz functions with the high and statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001) correlation coefficient (r(2) = 0.982, r(2) = 0.998) between estimated and observed values. Calculated values of Gompertz and Laird-Gompertz functions were a = 29.66, b = 3.03, c = 0.12; L-0 = 2.63, A(0) = 0.21; a = 0.08. Statistically significant differences between the lengths estimated by the function obtained from growth rings counting and the lengths of artificially reared larvae of the same age suggest that the growth of larvae is affected by temperature and density of food. Growth parameters should be estimated for every particular survey when the data on age of larvae are needed.},

abstract = {Australian salmon, Arripis trutta, collected from the east coast of Tasmania, Australia, in 1987, were weighed and measured and their otoliths marked by immersing fish in an oxytetracycline hydrochloride/seawater solution before placement in constant-temperature aquaria. Individual somatic and otolith growth rates were determined for input into mass balance models. Mass balance models were used to determine the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of otolith material produced during captivity. There was a significant relationship between delta-O-18 measured in the otolith aragonite and ambient temperature (r2 = 0.77). The linear relationship between these data, where delta-O-18 = 6.69 - 0.326 (T, degrees-C), was not significantly different from a relationship indicative of equilibrium deposition of oxygen isotopes in aragonite. Otolith carbon was significantly depleted in C-13 relative to equilibrium deposition, with depletions {\textgreater} 6.0 parts per thousand at all temperatures. There was no relationship between delta-C-13 and temperature. It was estimated that {\textgreater} 30{\%} of the otolith carbon was from metabolically derived sources. Significant differences in otolith carbon isotopes among wild juvenile Australian salmon were hypothesised to be attributable to differences in diet. Levels of variability for both oxygen and carbon isotopes in laboratory-maintained and wild fish were similar to that found by other researchers for foraminifera and these results highlight the importance of large sample sizes when estimating environmental temperatures from oxygen isotopes measured in fish otoliths.},

abstract = {Extensive data sets on the bioenergetics of the northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, and the patchy food distribution in its natural habitat allow its foraging dynamics to be inferred by modeling using techniques from population biology and behavioral ecology. The behavioral model consistently predicts that E. mordax grows much more slowly than would be expected with a pure, net-energy intake rate maximization strategy. The reduced growth rates could result from the fish avoiding zooplankton patches, where they are under increased predation risk, by swimming slowly in the waters between zooplankton patches. The combinations of growth rates and daily instantaneous mortality rates generated by the behavioral model are internally consistent with a Lefkovitch matrix population model, which includes an early juvenile stage of a stable and stationary population. Several novel and testable predictions are made by the behavioral model, including: (1) anchovies swim very slowly between zooplankton patch encounters; (2) within a patch fish swim very rapidly while searching for prey; and (3) fish often leave zooplankton patches before totally filling their stomachs. Given these encouraging initial results, the behavioral modeling approach appears to be a valuable technique for examining how potential habitat changes due to global warming may affect fish behavior and populations. Several such scenarios are proposed and discussed.},

abstract = {The relationship between the population size of the Japanese sardine, Sardinops melanostictus, and sea surface temperature (SST) from 1979 to 1994 was studied. Significant positive correlations were found between the natural mortality coefficient during the period from the postlarval stage to age 1 and winter-spring SST in the Kuroshio Extension and its southern recirculation area (30-35 degrees N, 145-180 degrees E). That is, higher (lower) SST over the possible migration route corresponded to higher (lower) mortality rate. This result is consistent with the high mortality and low population size for the high-SST period of the 1950's and 1960's and the population increase during the low-SST period of the 1970's and 1980's due to a decrease in mortality. The population decline after 1988 possibly occurred as a result of the abrupt increase in SST since 1988 in the Kuroshio Extension region and suggests a close relationship between interdecadal climate-ocean variability and sardine population size. This may also explain the relationship between biomass size and distribution area.},

abstract = {To determine the beginning and end of the transition period from larvae to juveniles in anchoveta Engraulis ringens, seven morphometric measurements were carried out in 333 laboratory-reared and 324 field-caught larvae. Measurements of body morphometrics were employed to calculate the six body ratios selected to show transition changes described in this study. The analysis was carried out with 'dummy variables' (variables that take only one of two possible values: 0 or 1) because a single model was used to indicate the point at which the slope changes in piecewise linear regressions. The regression coefficients of the relationship between ratios of morphometric measurements and body length were not significant in any case (P {\textgreater} 0 center dot 05) and, accordingly, a discrete length at which the slope changes could not be estimated. The ratio of the measurements according to the age showed two inflections, corresponding to the beginning and end of the transition period. The first inflection occurred between 32 and 64 days (average 46 days); the second inflection occurred between 81 and 149 days (average 107 days). Therefore, the transition period lasted c. 61 days, starting with a high growth rate, continuing with a slower growth phase, and ending with the onset of a new high growth rate period that corresponded to the start of typical juvenile growth. On the basis of these results, it is hypothesized that the transition from larvae to juveniles in E. ringens is determined more by age than body size.},

abstract = {Diaphus theta is one of the most common myctophid fish species in the subarctic and transitional waters of the North Pacific. The growth of larval and juvenile D. theta was investigated using sagittal otolith increment analysis of specimens caught in transitional waters of the western North Pacific. Samples taken over a 24-h period demonstrated that otoliths; exhibited daily growth cycles, allowing accurate determination of age. Calcification of the incremental zone of otoliths took place only at night, suggesting that the formation cycle of the increment of juvenile D. theta was different from that of shallow-water fishes and would be related to their diel vertical migration. The relationships between standard length (SL) and daily growth increment (D) were expressed as linear equations: SL 2.65 + 0.141 D (r(2) = 0.942) for larvae of 5.1-9.6 mm SL and SL = 3.54 + 0.129 D (r(2) 0.933) for juveniles of 13.7-27.6 mm SL. The growth rates were 0.14 mm d(-1) in larvae and 0.13 mm d(-1) in juveniles, this is slow compared with tropical or subtropical myctophid species. in which growth occurs at about twice these rates. The larval period, including the metamorphic stage, was long compared with species at lower latitudes and was estimated to be 71 days. The slow growth rate and long period of larval stage of D. theta would be the life history pattern of high-latitudinal species adapted to a low-temperature habitat.},

Six spawning areas and associated estuarine nurseries were sampled throughout southeastern Newfoundland. Samples of adults and juveniles isolated by {\textgreater} 25 km displayed moderate genetic differentiation F-ST similar to 0.05), whereas nearby ({\textless} 25 km) spawning and nursery samples displayed low differentiation (F-ST {\textless} 0.01). Self-assignment and mixture analysis of adult spawning samples supported the hypothesis of independence of isolated spawning locations ({\textgreater} 80{\%} self-assignment) with nearby runs self-assigning at rates between 50{\%} and 70{\%}. Assignment and mixture analysis of juveniles using adult baselines indicated high local recruitment at several locations (70-90{\%}). Nearby ({\textless} 25 km) estuaries at the head of St Mary's Bay showed mixtures of individuals (i.e. 20-40{\%} assignment to adjacent spawning location). Laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry transects across otoliths of spawning adults of unknown dispersal history were used to estimate dispersal among estuaries across the first year of life. Single-element trends and multivariate discriminant function analysis (Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) classified the majority of samples as estuarine suggesting limited movement between estuaries ({\textless} 0.5{\%}). The mixtures of juveniles evident in the genetic data at nearby sites and a lack of evidence of straying in the otolith data support a hypothesis of selective mortality of immigrants. If indeed selective mortality of immigrants reduces the survivorship of dispersers, estimates of dispersal in marine environments that neglect survival may significantly overestimate gene flow.},

abstract = {Lake-dwelling Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) are monitored internationally as a sentinel species for effects of atmospheric mercury deposition on Arctic fresh waters. We investigated the control of mercury supply and biological processes on the methylmercury (MeHg) content of their main food, aquatic chironomids, in 22 lakes and ponds in the Canadian High Arctic. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in sediment (corrected for organic matter content) increased with drainage basin size, suggesting a gradient in mercury loading among study sites. MeHg concentrations in sediment and water were low and relatively uniform along this THg supply gradient suggesting MeHg production in High Arctic lakes is weakly coupled to inorganic mercury supply. Metamorphosis was a key biological process that concentrated MeHg in adult chironomids 1.7-2.9 times more than in immature stages. Drainage basin size, environmental mercury levels, and habitat characteristics were also significant factors but they explained less variation in chironomid MeHg concentration than their degree of maturity. Chironomid larvae, pupae, and adults are district mercury sources for fish, and we provide evidence from nitrogen stable isotopes and published feeding studies that suggest differential consumption of these stages may affect MeHg uptake by Arctic char. We conclude that biological and food web processes have a greater impact on MeHg transfer to fish than atmospheric mercury deposition in High Arctic lakes.},

abstract = {Many benthic invertebrates and demersal fish have planktonic larvae and must therefore balance dispersal to new habitat with the need to settle where survival and growth are possible. We review published studies to determine whether the discontinuity in the literature between these groups represents a real ecological difference. Specifically, we examine the roles of biological and physical processes and the scales at which these processes act in pattern formation in fish and invertebrates. For most of the physical mechanisms that influence larval transport at different scales, we find examples of fish and invertebrate studies that are important at each scale. A comparison of planktonic durations suggests that more invertebrate species have highly limited dispersal potential. Comparison of dispersal potential and geographic range suggests that planktonic duration may play a role in defining the geographic range of species in both cases. Fish larvae were generally faster swimmers than invertebrate larvae, suggesting that swimming may contribute to pattern formation at larger spatial scales. In contrast, the documented capacity to delay metamorphosis is more prevalent in invertebrates and may be related to the greater mobility of adult fish relative to invertebrates. Ultimately, similar processes operate in both groups, although sometimes at different scales.},

We evaluated the efficacy of three highly water-soluble adjuvants (Montanidae IMS-1311, IMS-1312 and IMS-2212) combined with formalin-killed bacterin of Flavobacterium psychrophilum (FKB) in ayu, in comparison with a minimally water-soluble adjuvant (Montanidae ISA-763A). The retention period and toxicity of these adjuvants in ayu were also examined. Experimental challenge 4 wk after vaccination showed that FKB adjuvanted with IMS-1311 and IMS-1312 had higher potency than FKB alone and significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) higher potency than the control with sterile distilled water. Residues of the highly water-soluble adjuvants in ayu remained for shorter periods than that of the minimally water-soluble adjuvant, although the former adjuvants were acutely toxic at doses higher than 25 muL/fish(1.7 +/- 0.5 g). The high level of protection, short retention period and lack of toxicity indicate that a dose of 5 muL of IMS-1311 or IMS-1312 combined with 5 muL of FKB makes a promising vaccine against bacterial coldwater disease in ayu.},

abstract = {Survival and reproductive rates in fish are often a function of body size. Consequently, spatial- and sex-specific variation in somatic growth rates can have important consequences for population growth and resilience. We used otolith-based approaches to estimate geographic- and sex-specific growth rates of yellow-eyed mullet (Aldrichetta forsteri) collected from 14 estuaries and harbours around New Zealand. Aldrichetta forsteri is an abundant and dominant component of New Zealand's estuarine fish fauna. We extracted otoliths from 511 fish, validated daily and annual increments, and prepared transverse thin sections of otoliths to determine age. "Size-at-age" relationships were estimated using both linear- and non-linear (von Bertalanffy) growth models, and model performance was evaluated using Akaike's Information Criterion. Because growth rates of sampled fish were best approximated by linear functions, we used ANCOVA to test the null hypothesis that growth rates of A. forsteri were homogeneous between sexes and among geographic locations around New Zealand. Our analyses suggest heterogeneous growth rates between sexes and among locations. Interestingly, relative growth rates between sexes appeared to vary across separate latitudinal gradients for North Island and South Island. Within each island (but not across islands), female A. forsteri generally grew faster than males at the lowest latitudes; relative growth rates of females declined progressively below males with increasing latitude.},

abstract = {Batch fecundity (BF) of Japanese anchovy was estimated by analysis of ovarian egg size frequency around Miura Peninsula, in April through June in 1982 (a 'warm' year) and in 1984 (a 'cold' year). Total number of yolked eggs in an ovary (NT) increased with body size, showing variability in relation to GI. In 1982, the mean of relative NT (NTR = NT/SL3 x 10(3)) ranged from 22600 to 29400 with a maximum in May. In 1984 markedly lower values of 14500 in May and 16000 in June were observed. Estimated mean +/- S.D. of relative batch fecundity (BFR = BF/SL3 x 10(3)) in 1982 was 3400 +/- 900 in April, 7700 +/- 2300 in May, and 8400 +/- 2000 in June. These values were lower in 1984 than the same months in 1982, as 3400 +/- 1500 in May and 6500 +/- 2000 in June. The mean of BFR increased with increasing sea surface temperature (SST), showing a regression of BFR = -11200 + 910 x SST. We suggest that sea water temperature controls anchovy egg production, as large eggs in fewer numbers occur at low temperatures and higher numbers but smaller eggs at higher temperatures. Batch fecundity varied, showing high values with high NT and GI in May 1982. In 1984, batch fecundity was reduced by the enlarged size of eggs of both egg groups which was influenced by the extremely low temperatures.},

abstract = {A growth and survival model of the early life stages was run along virtual drift trajectories tracked in a hydrodynamic model to simulate the annual recruitment process of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic). These biophysical simulations concerning three different years were analysed in order to investigate the influence of environment and spawning dynamics on the survival of larvae and juveniles. The location of space-time survival windows suggested major environmental mechanisms involved in simulated recruitment variability at the different scales - retention of larvae and juveniles in favourable habitats over the shelf margins and turbulence effects. These small-scale and meso-scale mechanisms were related to the variations in wind direction and intensity during spring and summer. Survival was also variable according to the origin of the drift trajectories, that is spawning distribution in space and time. The observed spawning distribution (according to field surveys) was compared with the spawning distribution that would maximize survival (according to the biophysical model) on a seasonal scale, which revealed factors not considered in the biophysical model (e.g. spawning behaviour of the different age classes). The variation of simulated survival according to spawning distribution was examined on a multi-annual scale and showed a coherent pattern with past and present stock structures. The interaction processes between the population (influence on spawning) and its environment (influence on survival) and its implications on recruitment and stock dynamics are discussed.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of food level changes on otolith and somatic growth in postlarval Baltic sprat reared initially for a period of 11 days under zero, low, and ad libitum feeding conditions. During a subsequent 11 day period, feeding regimes were reversed in half of the low and ad libitum feeding treatments, and starved fish were re-fed ad libitum rations. Somatic growth rates under low and ad libitum food rations ranged between 0.15-0.22 mm day(-1) and 0.48-0.63 mm day(-1), respectively, and led to significant differences in length and weight between feeding regimes. Previously starved fish, however, grew only 0.25-0.28 mm day(-1) under ad libitum conditions. During the first period, significant linear relationships were found for otolith v. length and v. weight growth across all treatments. After changing feeding regimes, increment widths failed to significantly predict somatic growth for 9 days, after which a significant relationship between otolith and somatic growth became re-established. Recent otolith growth was a good predictor of fish condition after the first, but not after the second period. The results suggest that perturbations in environmental conditions can temporarily decouple otolith from somatic growth in postlarval sprat, which needs to be considered in field studies.},

abstract = {The sinusoidal swimming of fish, previously interpreted as foraging behaviour, was studied with respect to season, density of large zooplankton, fish length, time of the day, weather condition and solar radiation in A similar to imov Reservoir, Czech Republic, using a bottom-mounted, split-beam transducer (7A degrees, nominal angle; frequency 120 kHz). The proportion of sinusoidally swimming fish increased from April to August while this behaviour was absent in October. The occurrence of sinusoidal swimming showed an apparent pattern throughout the day; it increased sharply around sunrise, was highest within 5-6 h around solar noon, and sharply decreased around sunset. Significantly less frequent occurrence of sinusoidal swimming was recorded during cloudy days compared to sunny days. The vast majority of records came from fish of standard length ranging from 100 to 400 mm, which represents the typical size range of common bream Abramis brama and roach Rutilus rutilus of age {\textgreater} 1+, the main zooplanktivores in the reservoir. The presence of these larger fish in the open water of the reservoir, as well as the presence of sinusoidal swimming, apparently correlates with the presence of large zooplankton (Daphnia, Leptodora and Cyclops vicinus) in the epilimnion. The increase of sinusoidal swimming between April, June and finally August resulted in an increase of zooplankton component in fish guts. It appears that high values of solar radiation, and stable calm weather during high pressure periods, result in optimal optical conditions for sinusoidal swimming, making this foraging behaviour more efficient and widely used in fishes exploiting the zooplankton production in the reservoir.},

Simultaneous measurements were made of seawater temperature and salinity. Real-time AVHRR satellite images of sea surface temperature were processed onshore and transmitted to the ship at sea. Sardine and anchovy eggs were identified and counted live, at sea, and again ashore, preserved. A total of 2129 CUFES samples were collected during 41 d at sea and contained 62,409 sardine and 15,123 anchovy eggs. Sardine eggs were widespread and abundant in both cruises (mean concentrations: 5.2 and 5.1 eggs m(-3)) at and shoreward of the eastern boundary of the California Current. Anchovy eggs were found primarily inshore in the Southern California Eight and were less abundant (0.4 and 1.0 eggs m(-3), respectively, for the two cruises). Temperature-salinity plots indicated distinct separation of the spawning habitat of these two species and consistency in habitat between cruises in successive years. The distributions of sardine eggs and euphausiids collected by CUFES were complementary in space and time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) is a small, low-value, marine fish and is mainly targeted for nonfood uses. In this study, the enzymatic preparation and properties of iron-chelating peptides from anchovy muscle protein were evaluated. The results showed that the trypsin hydrolysate possessed the greatest iron-chelating activity, and the iron-chelating activity was governed by the degree of hydrolysis (DH) and the iron-chelating conditions (temperature and pH). Among the gel-filtration fractions, Fraction 1 and Fraction 3 exhibited higher iron-chelating activities, and the IC50 values were 0.048 and 0.086 mg/ml, respectively. A novo trypsin-resistant, large-molecular-weight, iron-chelating fraction was purified from Fraction 1, and was identified to be homologous with the conserved domain of the coiled-coil myosin heavy-chain tail region. Fraction 3 yielded two oligopeptides. Ser-(Gly)(7)-Leu-Gly-Ser-(Gly)(2)-Ser-Ile-Arg and Ile-(Glu)(2)-Leu-(Glu)(3)-Ile-Glu-AlaGlu-Arg. We thus conclude that anchovy might be beneficial as a bioresource to produce anti-anemia compounds which can be used in functional foods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus L is in high demand as a fish species, but most fishery stocks are currently at risk of collapsing. A pilot project for anchovy aquaculture was carried out in Spain to explore the potential of satisfying demand for fresh and canned fish and to establish a supportive breeding program that could enhance native populations. We have studied the spawning dynamics in this novel culture using microsatellite loci. Our main aims were to assess the effective breeding number (Isle) and the inbreeding coefficient that would result in use of these fish for an E. encrasicolus closed-cycle culture. A total of 183 wild breeders from the Bay of Biscay were adapted to culture and induced to spawn from November 2009 to January 2010. Two hundred and eighty-eight eggs were collected at four different times. Breeders and eggs were analyzed with two multiplex PCRs that included seven microsatellite loci. Breeders showed extremely high levels of genetic variation (mean number of alleles by locus=35), but there was a significant reduction in genetic variation in progeny. Breeders were also found to be genetically different from all progeny. Parentage was successfully assigned at a rate of 93{\%}. A total of 105 breeders (55 females and 50 males) took part in reproduction; however, there was significant unequal breeder contribution to progeny. Taking this into account, we found inbreeding coefficients and effective breeder numbers as follows: initial November Delta F=6.5{\%}, N(e)=8; mid-November Delta F=2.9{\%}, N(e)=17; December Delta F=3.2{\%}, N(e)=16; January Delta F=3.5{\%}, N(e)=14 and overall Delta F=1.8{\%}, N(e)=27. We have concluded that the partial dominance of some breeders and the high family variance found in this study should be taken into account when establishing closed-cycle cultures of the European anchovy to help guarantee its sustainability. If one of the main goals is establishment of a supportive breeding program to enhance wild stocks, the inbreeding levels found here, which imply significant genetic differentiation between breeders and progeny, should also be taken into account to avoid genetic damage to wild populations over time.

abstract = {The meteorological and oceanographic factors that have clear influence on the distribution of Engraulis encrasicolus eggs and larvae in shelf waters of the northeastern sector of the Gulf of Cadiz has been analyzed. Very high concentrations of anchovy eggs and larvae were found in this area during the spawning period (from March 2002 to September of 2002). The shallowness of the water column, the influence of the Guadalquivir River, and the local topography favor the existence of warm and chlorophyll-rich waters in the area, thus offering a favorable environment for the development of eggs and larvae. However, during spring and early summer intense easterlies were observed to cause a decrease of the water temperature by several degrees. Easterlies generate oligotrophic conditions in the area, and their persistence forces the offshore transport of waters over this portion of the shelf, advecting early life stages away from favorable conditions. These negative influences on the development conditions of anchovy eggs and larvae can impact on the recruitment of this species in the Gulf of Cadiz. Therefore, inter-annual fluctuations in the duration of intense easterly winds is analyzed and discussed in connection with anchovy catches. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two salmon, a female and a male, were released with a DSL and were recovered 7 h and 8 d after release, respectively; we provide image data of their views. Of the underwater photos taken from the female and male, 99 and 88 {\%} (of a total 842 and 831 images), respectively, were taken in good light conditions. Both chum salmon visited the sea surface and sea floor but stayed in shallow water most of time. The salmon sometimes encountered floats of fishing gear, other chum salmon, Nomura's jelly fish, and other organisms, but very few scallop culturing rafts. The results suggest that the salmon swam in a group during this phase of the homing migration. The salmon were not attracted to farming gear (for shade or refuge), and in fact seemed to avoid it. The present study demonstrated that a fish-borne DSL is a useful and reliable tool for monitoring fish behavior and the relationship between their behavior and the surrounding environment.},

abstract = {Six indicators were investigated for South African sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus: mean length of catch, length-at-50{\%} maturity, total mortality, exploitation rate, ratio of bycatch, and centre of gravity of commercial catches. Sardine length-at-50{\%} maturity is the most promising as a descriptive indicator because it is positively correlated with population size for an extensive time period (1953-2005). The remaining indicators were limited by shorter data-series (1984-2005). However, mean length of catch, ratio of bycatch and exploitation rate were found to be useful when considered in conjunction with other indicators. The centre of gravity of commercial sardine catches has shown a significant eastward shift from the West Coast, whereas that of anchovy has remained off that coast. Ratio of bycatch indicates that school composition is a reliable descriptive indicator of relative abundance in the two species. Fewer indicators for anchovy were useful, which is attributed to this species' flexible life-history pattern.},

We conducted 2 cruises of 3 d each in the Hudson River estuary, USA. The cruises were 1 wk apart, coinciding with spring and neap tides. We sampled every 2 h with an ichthyoplankton trawl to permit tests of time, depth, and lateral position on larval concentration. We also collected data on water-column structure with a CTD, and current velocity with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). We briefly sampled at several sites over a distance of 25 km along the river, and found that larvae of both species were uniformly abundant along this section although salinity decreased sharply with increasing distance upriver. Bay anchovy larvae were more abundant than goby larvae (median concentration 234 vs 6.6 ind. 100 m(-3)). Most sampling was conducted at an oligohaline location (mean salinity = 3 to 5 psu). Larvae were typically more concentrated at greater depths; among anchovy larvae during neap tide conditions, and goby larvae during neap and spring tide conditions, larvae were more concentrated at 6 and 8 m than at the surface by a factor of 2 to 9. Large larvae showed a stronger depth preference than small larvae. During spring tide, the water column was less stratified, and anchovy larvae under these conditions were uniformly distributed vertically. There were slight lateral differences in larval concentration, with fewer larvae in shallow water over the shoals than in similar depths in the main channel, We evaluated periodic cycles in flow and larval distributions via harmonic regression. Tidal constituents of the depth-averaged current flow included the K1 (period = 23.9 h), M2 (period = 12.4 h), and the M4 (period = 6.2 h) tides. Harmonic regression explained {\textgreater} 95{\%} of the observed variability in mean flow. Diel periodicity in depth-averaged larvae concentration was evident, particularly among large anchovy and goby larvae during neap tide conditions. Larvae were more abundant in the sampled depths at night than during the day by a factor of 3 to 10. There was also diel periodicity in the mean depth of goby larvae, such that larvae were about 2 m shallower at night than during the day. There was no periodic variability in the mean depth of anchovy larvae. We suggest that diel periodicity in larval concentration and mean depth reflects diel migration to shallower water at night, noting that temporal variability in net avoidance may also contribute to the periodicity. We conclude that anchovy and goby larvae exhibit a depth distribution and vertical migration behavior that promotes upriver transport. Transport should be most rapid during neap tide periods.},

abstract = {In the NW Mediterranean Sea, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are the most important small pelagic fish in terms of biomass and commercial interest. Round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) and Sprat (Sprattus sprattus) are also present in this region. This paper provides a general insight into the ecology of these species through a revision of the information available in an environmental context and in relation to exploitation features. Spawning habitats of the two main species, anchovy and sardine, are clearly differentiated based on water mass characteristics reducing the overlapping between their early developmental stages. Larval distribution is also related to major productivity mechanisms of the respective spawning seasons. In spite of the different environmental regimes in which larvae of these species develop, growth rates are fairly similar. Trophic modeling highlights the important ecological role of small pelagic fish in North Western Mediterranean ecosystems. This review points out the gaps in knowledge necessary to understand the dynamics of small pelagic fish in the region and to progress towards a precautionary and adaptive management.

abstract = {We modeled presence of anchovy and sardine eggs in the California Current from 1984 to 2009 using predictors related to water mass properties and primary productivity. Spawning areas could be predicted with good discrimination for anchovy, as indicated by logistic models with an area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC; i.e. probability of concordance) of 0.86, and acceptable discrimination for sardine, as indicated by an AUC of 0.79. Knowledge of 3-dimensional characteristics of the water column was particularly important for predicting anchovy spawning habitat, as indicated by 2 variables: depth at which maximum chlorophyll a (chl a) occurred and an index of geostrophic flow. These variables were not useful predictors in the sardine model. For both species, variables related to low productivity limited modeled spawning probability most frequently during the 1980s and 1990s, but low temperature was most frequently limiting during the 2000s. Egg abundance was extremely patchy for both species; models to predict numbers of eggs conditional on their presence had almost no additional predictive ability for either species. However, most eggs occurred in areas where predicted probabilities of egg presence were relatively high. About 80{\%} of anchovy eggs were captured in 40{\%} of the samples that had modeled capture probabilities {\textgreater}= 0.25. About 80{\%} of sardine eggs were captured in 35{\%} of the samples that had predicted probabilities of capture {\textgreater}= 0.25. These models may be useful for understanding interannual changes in populations of predators that depend on anchovies and sardine. They could also improve the precision of fisheries surveys if predictors were collected beforehand using unmanned gliders.},

The present study examines the reproductive demography of Odax pullus, an herbivorous and protogynous species of temperate New Zealand. We establish an otolith-based methodology for age estimation and investigate sex-specific growth, longevity and age-based reproductive events. Individuals achieved a maximum age of 11 years, reached 85{\%} of adult body size (455 mm FL) within the first 3.5 years of life, were sexually mature by the age of 1.1-1.5 years and changed sex at 2.8-3.5 years, indicating fast simultaneous somatic and reproductive growth. There was no significant difference in growth or body size between the sexes. Ovary weight of spawning females increased significantly with size and age, suggesting the presence of size- and age-fecundity skews underlying the absence of sex change in larger and older females. Testes of reproductively active males comprised less than 1{\%} of bodyweight, suggesting pair-spawning and little sperm competition. The present study provides metrics to support comparisons of the demography of this temperate protogynous and herbivorous labrid across spatial or temporal strata.},

Screening of index behaviors, which reflect fish quality, should be an important approach. In this point of view, we have been investigating aggressive behavior in the seedlings of yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) and Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), because aggressive behavior has an important role for the survival in the early life stages of these 2 species. We found typical shivering behaviors in the metamorphosing larvae and named them J-posture in yellowtail and Omega-posture in Japanese flounder, respectively. Both postures were significantly and positively related to aggression in the juvenile stage, and we can predict which larva will become an aggressive juvenile. We propose that these postures will be applicable for future index of fish quality for release.},

Reported biomass estimate of adult anchovy in the southern coastal area of Korea for the May-July period ranged from 0.14 to 0.56 x 10(6) mt, but my simulation-based cohort analysis indicated that the biomass level of larval, juvenile and adult anchovy is seasonally variable and could reach 1.9 x 10(6) mt in early November. Estimated potential production of anchovies of egg to age-2 stages was 8.1 x 10(6) mt yr(-1). which peaked in September Age-0 anchovies accounted for 84{\%} of the estimated annual mean biomass and 92{\%} of the annual potential production. Comparison of monthly length frequencies of anchovies between the simulation and the samples of fisheries catch suggested that catches from January to May consisted of anchovies spawned in the previous year (the 2nd year anchovy) whereas those from June to December were mostly from young-of-the-year anchovies. Estimated instantaneous fishing mortality derived from the catch statistics (ca. 0.25 x 10(6) mt in 2006) and the estimated annual production by anchovy {\textgreater}30 mm fork length (ca. 5.9 x 10(6) mt) was 0.40 yr(-1), which was marginal compared with the estimated natural mortality, 11.29 yr(-1). The ratio of annual production to mean biomass was 6.7 yr(-1). Ongoing acoustic surveys will validate and improve my stock assessment of anchovy, which is critical in possible fisheries management of anchovy in Korea. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Nutritional condition of anchovy Engraulis anchoita larvae from Northern Argentinean sea was assessed and compared in three areas characterized by dissimilar oceanographic features (estuarine, mixed and shelf waters). Morphometrical, histological and biochemical (RNA/DNA) indexes were used and larvae were compared through different developmental stages. Multivariate analyses performed on normalized morphometric variables showed that larvae from mixed waters where characterized by higher body depths; variables that indicate a better nutritional condition. Mean histological condition index obtained for larvae at intermediate developmental stages was significantly lower in estuarine waters than those estimated with samples from mixed or shelf waters. Anchovy larvae from the mixed water area showed a higher slope in the log RNA versus log DNA relationship than larvae from the other areas, which indicates that the former were in better condition. Also, standardized RNA/DNA index (RNA/DNA(s)) resulted slightly better in mixed waters than in shelf area, for larvae at intermediate developmental stages, but due to the high variability of RNA/DNA ratio, no significant differences were found between areas. Finally, using literature equations relating RNA/DNAs, temperature and growth, growth rate and growth performance were estimated. Mean growth performance did not differ between areas and was temperature independent. In conclusion, larval condition was relatively high at all stations, but our results suggested that it was slightly better in frontal areas characterized by water masses with intermediate salinities. We also provide evidence that anchovy larvae might not be food limited in any of the studied areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Growth rate effects on the relationship between otolith size and body size were examined in larval and juvenile goldfish. They were kept under the same environmental and feeding conditions, and sampled ad libitum until 154 days after hatching. Therefore, their variations in body size will be explained by internally mediated constraints on growth. After measurement of body size in standard length, three kinds of otolith were dissected under a binocular microscope and their morphological changes were noted. The asteriscus was too small to be dissected consistently at hatching. The sagitta was considerably deformed with growth. The lapillus was relatively large at hatching and grew steadily from a round to a pear shape. For this reason, lapilli alone were used to measure otolith length (diameter or long axis) and to count the number of otolith increments. Otoliths had three increments at hatching and subsequent increments deposited on a daily basis until at least 154 days after hatching. The relationship between otolith and body length showed an excellent correlation (r=0.92-0.97) within three groups which had different growth rates. However, analysis of covariance revealed a different slope of regression among the groups. This indicates that slow-growing fish have larger otoliths than equal-sized, rapidly growing fish.},

Therefore, it is urgent to use a more conservative management approach to protect this declining fish resource. Based on the stock-recruitment (SR) data from 1987 to 2002, the Bayesian method in which uncertainties are treated explicitly is used to assess the SR relationship, the age-structured production model is applied to calculate the biological reference points (BRPs). The Monte Carlo simulation method is performed to predict the expected outcomes in the future for a ran-e of harvest rate. Then, a conservative management approach is recommended.

abstract = {The Antarctic icefishes ( Family Channichthyidae) provide excellent examples of unique traits that can arise in a chronically cold and isolated environment. Their loss of hemoglobin (Hb) expression, and in some cases, loss of myoglobin (Mb) expression, has taught us much about the function of these proteins. Although absences of the proteins are fixed traits in icefishes, the losses do not appear to be of adaptive value. Contrary to some suggestions, loss of Hb has led to higher energetic costs for circulating blood, and losses of Mb have reduced cardiac performance. Moreover, losses of Hb and Mb have resulted in extensive modifications to the cardiovascular system to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to working muscles. Recent studies suggest that losses of Hb and Mb, and their associated nitric oxide (NO)-oxygenase activities, may have accelerated the development and evolution of these cardiovascular modifications. The high levels of NO that should occur in the absence of Hb and Mb have been shown in other animal groups to lead to an increase in tissue vascularization, an increase in the lumenal diameter of blood vessels, and an increase in mitochondrial densities. These characteristics are all hallmark traits of Antarctic icefishes. Homeostatic feedback mechanisms thus may have accelerated evolution of the pronounced cardiovascular traits of Antarctic icefishes.},

abstract = {Distribution of oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in fish otoliths from a wide range of species was investigated to determine if the isotopes were deposited in equilibrium with ambient seawater and, the potential utility of isotope data to studies of fish biology. Comparison of delta-O-18 and delta-C-13 data from otoliths with estimates of equilibrium aragonite indicate that O-18, but not C-13, was deposited near equilibrium and this confirms the utility of otolith oxygen isotopes as an indicator of ambient temperature. The departure of delta-C-13 from equilibrium was considered in light of several current theories on C-13 isotope disequilibrium. There was a strong correlation between delta-C-13 and temperature and, concomitantly, a strong relationship between delta-O-18 and delta-C-13. Evidence is presented to support the importance of metabolic effects in mediating C-13 disequilibria and a strong relationship between metabolic rate (VO2) and delta-C-13 is hypothesized. Fishes with low metabolic rates or those living at low temperatures had C-13 deposited near to equilibrium, whereas fishes living at higher temperatures showed extreme depletion in otolith C-13. Trends were also evident in delta-C-13 values in juveniles and adults of a species with the juveniles, presumably with a higher metabolic rate, being more depleted in C-13 than the adults. The study shows that both oxygen and carbon stable isotopes have great potential in studies of fish biology and are worthy of further investigation.},

A strong hydrolysis development could be assessed for all storage conditions, although a partial hydrolysis inhibition (p {\textless} 0.05) could be attained as a result of the presence of salt (S and IS conditions). In contrast, a lower (p {\textless} 0.05) primary lipid oxidation compound formation could be observed for individuals kept under I conditions. This conclusion was confirmed by the interaction compound formation study (fluorescence and browning developments) between oxidized lipids and protein-type molecules. Accordingly, a higher lipid oxidation was inferred as a result of NaCl addition to fish (S and IS conditions).},

abstract = {Fish recruitment is the result of the integration of small-scale processes affecting larval survival over a season and large oceanic areas. A hydrodynamic model was used to explore and model these physical-biological interaction mechanisms and then to perform the integration from individual to population scales in order to provide recruitment predictions for fisheries management. This method was applied to the case of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) in the Bay of Biscay (NE Atlantic). The main data available to investigate survival mechanisms were past growth (otolith) records of larvae and juveniles sampled at sea. The drift history of these individuals was reconstructed by a backtracking procedure using hydrodynamic simulations. The relationships between (real) growth variation and variations in physical parameters (estimated by hydrodynamic simulations) were explored along the individual trajectories obtained. These relationships were then used to build and adjust individual-based growth and survival models. Thousands of virtual buoys were released in the hydrodynamic model in order to reproduce the space-time spawning dynamics. Along the buoy trajectories (representative of sub-cohorts), the biophysical model was run to simulate growth and survival as a function of the environment encountered. The survival rate after 3 months of drift was estimated for each sub-cohort. The sum of all these survival rates over the season constituted an annual recruitment index. This index was validated over a series of recruitment estimations. The modelling choices, model results and the potential use of the recruitment index for fisheries management are discussed.},

Histological criteria were shown to be reliable in diagnosing nutritional condition, because they involve the study of cellular aspect, structure and tissular integrity. However, since the microscopical appearance of larval tissues varies both as a consequence of nutritional status and developmental stages, it becomes necessary to characterize the employed structures and to take into account the developmental stage of the studied specimen. The aim of this study was to develop a typical micro-anatomical description to assess the nutritional condition of Engraulis anchoita fish larvae collected in the Argentine Sea. Several tissues were diagnosed to calculate a histological condition index (ICH) in regards to anchovy larvae ontogeny. In addition, the tissues analysed were divided into short and long-term indices. A reduction of HCI was observed during yolk exhaustion and at the end of the larval stage. In order to detect slight changes in histological condition, short term tissues proved to be more sensitive to starvation than long term tissues.},

Using fishes in the same size range (80-140 mm, standard length), the stomach contents of the three fish species were compared. The diet of the Japanese anchovy mainly consisted of Oncaeidae copepods, while the diets of the Pacific round herring and Japanese jack mackerel were dominated by calanoid copepods at all stations. Comparisons between prey size in the stomach, zooplankton size in the water and gill raker morphology suggested that the stomach contents of the three species were characterized mainly by the difference in the feeding behaviour between Japanese anchovy (filter-feeding) and the other two species (particulate-feeding), rather than by the difference in the morphology of feeding apparatus only. It was concluded that behavioural adaptations in the feeding of these pelagic fishes brought about trophic partitioning to some degree in this pelagic ecosystem in summer. Although the diets of these three species overlapped to some extent, there was still little likelihood of competition between the Japanese anchovy and the other two species. The potential for competition between the Pacific round herring and the Japanese jack mackerel is discussed.},

As transport of eggs and early larvae is considered to be one of the major factors impacting on anchovy recruitment success, this approach may be useful to understand further the recruitment variability in this economically and ecologically important species. By coupling the IBM to a 3D hydrodynamic model of the region called Plume, and by varying parameters such as the spatial and temporal location of spawning, particle buoyancy, and the depth range over which particles were released, we could assess the influences of these parameters on transport success. A sensitivity analysis using a General Linear Model identified the primary determinants of transport success in the various experimental simulations, and model outputs were examined and compared with patterns observed in field studies. Model outputs compared well with observed patterns of vertical and horizontal egg distribution. Particle buoyancy and area of particle release were the major single determinants of transport success, with an egg density of 1.025 g cm(-3) maximizing average particle transport success and the western Agulhas Bank being the most successful spawning area. This IBM may be useful as a generic prototype for other upwelling ecosystems.},

The model combines sagittal otolith readings (core and individual increment measurements), larval standard length and weight data, and solves an over-determined set of linear system equations for all parameters using the method of least square residuals. The model consists of a matrix, which describes the increment width formation of 119 larvae, a vector containing their length/weight measurements, and a vector describing residuals. The solution vector yields age-dependent maximum somatic growth rates of herring larvae up to an age of 41 days with sizes ranging from 10 to 25 mm. The observed environmental temperature in which larvae dwelled was relatively uniform. Therefore, measured increment width was individually used to determine daily growth from any single larva in relation to their potential maximum growth under optimal feeding conditions. The results are discussed with respect to the spatial and temporal variability of larval occurrence. Finally, an analysis of error estimation of the larval growth characteristics is presented.},

@article{Fuiman2011,
abstract = {Recent work has suggested that provisioning of eggs with certain critical nutrients could be a more meaningful measure of maternal investment and correlate of offspring fitness than traditional measures of egg size. The aim of our study was to assess variability in egg quality and larva quality and to identify connections between them and the implications for larval survival. Egg size, proximate composition, and fatty acid composition were measured for 40 batches of eggs from 8 captive pairs of red drum (Osteichthyes: Sciaenops ocellatus). We reared larvae from these batches of eggs to a common size (10 mm total length, 2-3 weeks posthatching) and assessed routine activity and escape response performance of 671 individuals. Egg fatty acid composition varied more than egg size or proximate composition. Concentrations of certain long chain, highly unsaturated essential fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) were the only egg traits that were significantly related to larva quality (measured as escape performance). Reduced escape performance of larvae from eggs with low fatty acid concentrations was not compensated by 3 weeks of feeding on a diet enriched with fatty acids, suggesting irreversible developmental effects. Since fatty acids in eggs originate from the maternal diet, offspring survival may be determined in part by availability of nutrient-rich prey to pre-spawning adults. Migrations, regime shifts, and exploitation of marine communities could operate through this mechanism to influence recruitment in fish populations. Our findings underscore the importance of non-genetic maternal contributions to egg quality and the linkage between environmental conditions experienced by adult females and offspring fitness.

Methional and (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one were the most potent odorants among eighteen odorants in the flavor dilution range of 10-1000. Eleven odorants were detected by GCO-H of 20 mL headspace samples of ripened anchovy equilibrated at 35 degrees C. Results of GCO-H were in good agreement with those of AEDA in that methional and (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one were perceived at the small headspace samples of ripened anchovy (1 mL). Based on results of GCO-H, acetaldehyde, 3-methyl-butanal and 3-methyl-ropanal were the most intense odorants among the highly volatile constituents of ripened anchovy.},

An improved version of Tanaka's graphical method for analyzing polymodal distributions using computer graphics is proposed.  Comparisons of frequency distributions by five egg size indexes verify the validity of the major axis as a reasonable fit to a normal distribution and measurement cost.  The effect of sample size on the analysis is tested by a sampling experiment from a simulated trimodal population. Ovaries taken in 1982 and 1984 were analyzed using this method.  Major egg size frequencies were separated into two normal distributions and small frequencies into three.  The monthly mean diameter of large and small egg groups in the cold year of 1984 are larger than those in the same month in 1982, a normal year.  The mean diameter of the large egg group decreases, and the proportion of large eggs increases seasonally from April to June.  Temperature-dependent changes of size observed in planktonic eggs is also recognized with compensating control of the mixing proportion in the large ovarian egg group.},

abstract = {Larval fish settlement in estuarine nursery areas is the end result of numerous biological and physical processes. We used a numerical circulation model coupled to a particle transport model to examine the role that physics play in determining settlement patterns of red drum larvae (Sciaenops ocellatus) in nursery habitat along the Texas coast. We examined supply at various spatial scales (supply to inlet, bays, and individual settlement sites). Temporal patterns in larval settlement in Aransas Bay, Texas, are correlated with several indices of modeled particle supply (number of particles inside the bays, integrated particle input to Lydia Ann Channel, and cumulative number of competent particles in Lydia Ann Channel). High abundances of recently settled red drum in Aransas Bay result from a combination of high larval input, limited habitat for settlement, and proximity of habitat to the inlet. In contrast, larval settlement in Corpus Christi and Redfish Bays does not appear to be related to modeled measures of larval supply. Modeled particle supply at the bay-scale suggests that difference in the abundance of recently settled red drum between the bays may be related to larval supply normalized by the amount available settlement habitat within the bay.

First, the most common multinomial models for ordinal categorical data (namely, proportional odds, continuation-ratio, and extended continuation-ratio models) are described within the particular framework of developmental rates for discrete and ordered stage classified biological processes. Then, the extraction from the fitted models of a series of biologically meaningful parameters is proposed. In particular, maximum probable age and several alternative definitions for stage duration are presented and pros and cons of each of them are discussed. As an example, the methodology is applied to analyze the temperature dependent development of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) eggs in the Bay of Biscay.},

abstract = {Evolutionary simulations are developed to explore environmental constraints that select observed spatial and temporal spawning patterns for anchovy (Engraulis capensis) in the southern Benguela. They couple a realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with an individual-based model in which an evolutionary-based reproductive strategy for adult fish and a passive transport for early life stages are implemented. The evolutionary success of spawning is quantified when patterns at the population level emerge after many generations from constraints at the individual level through a selective process. As a result, several self-sustaining populations are identified considering different sets of selective constraints. Simulated spawning patterns better match the observed mean spawning pattern when two selective environmental constraints are associated: a threshold temperature of 14degreesC, above which the development of early life stages is ensured, and the avoidance of offshore currents that constitute a loss of spawning products. Simulated recruitment patterns are more realistic when considering the constraint of reaching the nursery area. This modeling experience can help to identify, temporally and spatially, environmental factors important for fish recruitment and to establish a hierarchy of these factors. The probable coexistence in nature of several self-sustaining populations of pelagic fishes is shown to be important for recruitment studies.},

In the AMA, tadpoles were exposed to mean measured 2,4-D concentrations of 0 (water control), 0.273, 3.24, 38.0 and 113 mg acid equivalents (ae)/L for either seven or 21 days. In the FSTRA, fathead minnows were exposed to mean measured 2,4-D concentrations of 0 (water control), 0.245, 3.14, 34.0, and 96.5 mg ae/L for 21 days. The respective concentrations of 2,4-D were not overtly toxic to either Xenopus laevis tadpoles or fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). In the AMA, there were no signs of either advanced or delayed development, asynchronous development, or significant histopathological effects of the thyroid gland among 2,4-D exposed tadpoles evaluated on either day seven or day 21 of the exposure. Therefore, following the AMA decision logic, 2,4-D is considered "likely thyroid inactive" in the AMA with a No Observable Effect Concentration (NOEC) of 113 mg ae 2,4-D/L. In the FSTRA, there were no significant differences between control and 2,4-D exposed fish in regard to fertility, wet weight, length, gonadosomatic indices, tubercle scores, or blood plasma concentrations of vitellogenin. Furthermore, there were no treatment-related histopathologic changes in the testes or ovaries in any 2,4-D exposed group. The only significant effect was a decrease in fecundity among fish exposed to 96.5 mg ae 2,4-D/L The cause of the reduced fecundity at the highest concentration of 2,4-D tested in the assay was most likely due to a generalized stress response in the fish, and not due to a specific endocrine mode of action of 2,4-D. Based on fish reproduction, the NOEC in the FSTRA was 34.0 mg ae 2,4-D/L (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A suite of divalent metal (Ca, Cd, Ba) carbonates was synthesized over the temperature range 10-40 degrees C by the classical method of slowly bubbling N-2 through a bicarbonate solution. It was discovered that carbonates could be precipitated reproducibly in or out of isotopic equilibrium with the environmental solution by varying the concentrations of bicarbonate and cation, Precipitation rate had little or no influence on the isotopic composition of the product. Relatively high initial concentrations of up to 25 mM in both bicarbonate and cation were prepared by adding solid metal chlorides to solutions of NaHCO3. On the basis of results of equilibrium experiments and a new determination of the acid fractionation factor, a new expression is proposed for the oxygen isotope fractionation between calcite and water at low temperatures: 10001n alpha(Calcite-H2O) = 18.03(10(3)T(-1))-32.42 where alpha is the fractionation factor, and T is in kelvins. Combining new data for low-temperature precipitations and the high-temperature equilibrium fractionations published by O'Neil et al. (1969) results in a revised expression for the oxygen isotope fractionation between octavite (CdCO3) and water from 0 degrees to 500 degrees C: 10001n alpha(CdCO3-H2O) = 2.76(10(6)T(-2))-3.96 The ability to produce nonequilibrium carbonates allowed assessment to be made, for the first time, of the temperature dependence of nonequilibrium stable isotope fractionations in mineral systems. The temperature coefficients of cu(carbonate-water) for nonequilibrium divalent metal carbonates are greater than those for equilibrium carbonates, a finding that may bear on the interpretation of analyses of biogenic carbonates forming out of isotopic equilibrium in nature. New determinations of acid fractionation factors (10001n alpha) at 25 degrees C for calcite (10.44 +/- 0.10), aragonite (11.01 +/- 0.01), and witherite (10.57 +/- 0.16) are mildly to strongly different from those published by Sharma and Clayton (1965) and point to a control on this fractionation by some physical property of the mineral. Reproducible values for octavite (CdCO3) varied from 11.18 to 13.60 depending on the conditions of preparation of the carbonate. These new values need to be considered in determinations of absolute O-18/O-16 ratios of international reference standards and in relating analyses of carbonates to those of waters, silicates, and oxides.

Two unrelated patients, 21- and 16-year-old males, with cleft lip and palate and multiple jaw cysts, were diagnosed according to clinical criteria. To confirm a diagnosis of NBCCS, we undertook a molecular genetic analysis of the PTCH gene. Their PTCH genes were analyzed by direct sequencing of the PCR product from their DNA, and previously unreported mutations were identified. A heterozygous duplication at the nucleotide position between 3325 and 3328 of the PTCH gene (c. 3325{\_}3328dupGGCG) was detected in the 21-year-old patient. It caused a frameshift mutation, resulting in a premature termination of the PTCH protein. A point mutation (G to C) in intron 7 of the PTCH gene (c.1067+1G{\textgreater}C) was detected in the 16-year-old patient. This caused an aberrant splicing of PTCH. It is interesting to note that the non-canonical cryptic splice-donor site was activated, which did not conform to the GT-AG rule.

abstract = {This study examines some basic characteristics of the Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus S.) population arriving at the southernmost area of its distribution range in the I-Ian Bay, NE Taiwan. These characteristics include recruitment dynamics, body length-sagittal radius relationship, weight-length relationship, von Bertalanffy growth curve, hatching date, and ontogenetic and time series variation of growth rate. Monotonic relationships between various parameters were first established, and then the difference between two seasonal cohorts was compared using back-calculated length and weight from sagittal increment analysis. During our study period from March to November 1998, we found two cohorts of Japanese anchovy recruited to the bay area: the spring cohort (March-May) with a hatching peak interval of 4 days, and the late-summer cohort (August-September) with that interval of 5.5 days. Most suitable models have been selected to characterize body measurement and to compare the difference between the two cohorts. Significant differences were found between the cohorts for standard length-sagittal radius and weight-length relationships. On the ontogenetic basis, the growth difference between the two cohorts occurred at the age of 4-5 weeks, where spring cohort (0.48-0.58 mm. SL per day) grew faster in length than that of the late summer (0.40-0.45 mm per day). However, the late-summer cohort always increased their body weight per unit length greater than spring; the difference ranged from 0.08 to 0.59 mg per day. On weekly time series basis, when all larval size had been standardized to their age at 10 days, the overall mean daily growth in body length did not differ between the cohorts (ca. 0.67 mm per day). However, significant difference was found when the growth was measured by body weight; the growth rates were 1.6 and 2.3 mg per day for spring and late-summer cohort, respectively. We also found that the growth rates were significantly correlated with ambient water temperature, expressed by a quadratic function with an optimal temperature at about 25 degreesC. They were also negatively correlated with catch per unit effort (CPUE), in which possible density-dependent growth was postulated. In summary, the spring cohort generally had a larger recruitment size, higher daily growth rate and bigger maximal body length, while the late-summer cohort always gained a bigger body weight per day at each unit length over the spring cohort. The differences on the growth of the two cohorts resulted from the ontogenetic differences and the temporal variations due to both the environmental temperature and its recruitment size.

abstract = {In this paper, the first daily egg production method (DEPM) parameters were estimated for anchovy and common sardine stocks distributed in the central-south area off Chile (33-40 degrees S). The study area was stratified according to the topography, shape and orientation of the coastal line, and the survey was carried out on the continental shelf during the main spawning peak (August-September, 2002). The bulk of the spawning of both species was successfully covered, which was characterized by a coastal distribution within the first 20 nautical miles, and following the inner zone associated with the 100 m bottom depth. The coastal distribution of the spawning can be related to the oceanographic conditions occurring during the transition from winter to spring (southern Hemisphere), which are characterized by the alternation between northerly and southerly winds. Probably, these factors are interacting to produce enrichment, concentration and retention of egg in coastal zones in the study area. The daily egg production rate (PO) was estimated for two geographic strata, and was different in each region. Also, the length frequency and adult reproductive parameters were different between geographic strata, specially the daily spawning fraction. For anchovy, the PO was lower in comparison with available estimates for the same species in Peru and in the north area off Chile. Also, the relative fecundity of anchovy was lower, probably because anchovy in the study area have bigger eggs as compared with the anchovy in Northern Chile. The DEPM parameters estimated for common sardine in the investigated area were similar to the range of existing values for the Engraulis genus in other upwelling areas. The stratified spawning stock biomass estimate was 133,031 t (CV = 44{\%}) for anchovy and 706,792 t (CV = 68{\%}) for common sardine. Probably, daily egg production and adult reproductive parameters of both species are highly variables and further research is suggested for improvements future DEPM application for the species.

abstract = {Low dissolved oxygen concentrations can affect growth rates, distributions and predator-prey interactions of aquatic organisms. Each of these potential effects is generally examined separately in laboratory and field studies. As a result, it is often difficult to determine the net influence of low oxygen on survival and which individual effect of low oxygen contributes most to mortality. We used a spatially explicit individual-based predation model to predict how effects of low dissolved oxygen on vertical distributions, predation rates, and larval growth combine to influence survival of estuarine fish larvae in a water column where the subpycnocline (bottom) and pycnocline layers are subject to oxygen depletion, We analyzed simulations involving 3 predators (scyphomedusae based on Chrysaora quinquecirrha, and fish that were relatively sensitive to, or tolerant of, low dissolved oxygen), water columns that differed in the relative thickness of the subpycnocline layer, and bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations ranging from cl mg l(-1) to no-effect concentrations. The effect of dissolved oxygen on larval and predator Vertical distributions, predator capture success and larval growth rates in simulations were based on previous experiments and field sampling in the Patuxent River. a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. Simulations indicated that bottom dissolved oxygen can strongly affect predation mortality of fish larvae. Thus, there is the potential for eutrophication to have a large effect on larval fish survival, and possibly recruitment, even in the absence of direct effects of low oxygen-induced mortality of larvae or the effects of nutrient enrichment on the abundance of larval prey or predators. Depending on predator characteristics and water column depth, lowest larval survival occurred when oxygen concentrations were either {\textless}1 mg l(-1) or sufficiently high that oxygen concentration had no effect on distributions or capture rates; highest survival generally occurred with hypoxic bottom layers (1 to 2 mg l(-1) dissolved oxygen). Bottom dissolved oxygen concentration also strongly affected the relative importance of fish and sea nettle predation in simulations that included both types of predators. Differences among predator types had important consequences for the magnitude and location of predation. Bottom-layer oxygen depletion shifted the focus of trophic interactions into the pycnocline and surface layers. Additional simulations indicated that distributional and capture success effects on larval survival were more important than growth rate effects, and that the direction of effects depended on the predator type and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Limitations of the model as well as implications of results for efforts to reduce nutrient loadings into estuaries are discussed.},

abstract = {We applied a stage-specific population matrix, the Lefkovitch matrix, to the northern anchovy Engraulis mordax and the Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax to determine which vital rates in the life history have the most effect on population growth. Three vital rates considered are the daily stage-specific instantaneous mortality rate, stage duration and daily age-specific fecundity per female. The models incorporate variability in growth rates among individuals and link simpler stage-based and more complicated individual-based modeling approaches. The elasticity of population growth rate for anchovy percentage change from a 1{\%} change of a vital rate was greatest for mortality in yolk-sac larvae, fecundity of 2 yr old fish (111 to 135 mm), and stage duration in late larvae (11 to 35 mm). For sardine, elasticity was greatest for mortality in life stages of egg and yolk-sac larvae, fecundity of 5 and 6 yr old fish (211 to 250 mm), and stage duration in the early larvae (5 to 10 mm). When stage duration was variable, elasticity was 1/10 as large as when stage duration was constant, indicating that sensitivity of populations to changes in vital rates is reduced by variation in growth rates. Population growth rates for both species increased with variance in individual growth rates. Thus, a population with individuals that grow at varying rates is more likely to increase. Our models indicate that growth rates are important determinants of population growth and recruitment and it is Likely that growth and mortality rates are linked. We suggest, therefore, that inexpensive estimates of larval growth rates could be used to help forecast future recruitment.},

Advanced-stage eggs and early larvae with notochord length (L-N) of {\textless} 7.5 mm were collected from the inner bay near the mouth of the Sagami River. Feeding larvae of {\textgreater} 8.4 mm L-N were distributed in the mouth of the river, and juveniles of 24-90 mm standard length (L-S) were collected from the lower reaches of the river between the river mouth and c. 3 km upstream of the river mouth.

The relationship between the otolith radius (R-O) and L-N or L-S changed during the metamorphosis stage as characterized by 320 mu m R-O and 22 mm L-S. Otolith growth rate, as an index of somatic growth rates in larval and early juvenile stages, was higher in cohorts that hatched later in the spawning season, i.e. from March to July. Konosirus punctatus that were spawned in the bay mouth area survived with different growth histories in the bay and lower reaches of the river, and recruited to the young-of-year population in the Pacific coastal waters of central Japan.

@article{Takada2009,
abstract = {1. Carassius auratus, a primary freshwater fish with bisexual diploid and unisexual gynogenetic triploid lineages, is distributed widely in and around the Eurasian continent and is especially common in East Asia. East Asian C. auratus diverged genetically to form local endemic populations in different regions, and those distributed in the Ryukyu Archipelago form a local endemic population that can be regarded as an evolutionarily significant unit because of its high phylogenetic independence and evolutionary distinctiveness. Although the evolutionary uniqueness of this population should be conserved, its distribution area and population size are decreasing rapidly, and some island populations are currently considered endangered or already extinct. 2. To develop effective conservation measures to stop the current decline of Ryukyuan C. auratus, ecological data need to be collected. In this study, life history data for a C. auratus population distributed in the Hiji River system were collected by estimating age, growth, and spawning season. 3. The spawning season of C. auratus in the Hiji River extended from March to September, peaking during March-May. Females became sexually mature in their second year, but males reached maturity and were able to spawn as early as in the late spawning season of their year of hatching. Once having reached sexual maturity, males probably continuously stay ripe throughout their life. 4. Sagittal otoliths of C. auratus proved to be useful ageing structures because one annual increment is formed on the sagittal otolith before the spawning season in each year. The oldest fish observed were a 10-year-old female and an 11-year-old male. Females showed faster somatic growth and higher final standard length than males, and a sexual size dimorphism was observed. 5. The standard length at each age class did not differ between diploid and triploid C. auratus, suggesting that triploid growth rates were almost equal to those of diploids.

@article{Hoda1971,
abstract = {The main object of the present investigations was to work out on the problems in relation to the culture and the propagation of the carp. From this point of view a detailed study of the spawning behaviour, embryology, larval growth, digestive system, and other organs of the carp reared in the experimental pond of Fisheries Laboratory, Kyushu University, was made on the basis of microscopic preparations. The following distinctive remarks would be noteworthy. 1. The carp spawns on vegetations or like substances at an optimum water temperature of 22-24℃ for nearly 6 hours at any time of the day, but usually at dawn from April to July at short and irregular intervals. During the spawning act the male nudges the female from behind and approximates the genital part, lying almost parallel to her side. Both lash the caudal region forcibly, discharging simultaneously the ova and milt, and then separate after swimming together for about 30-50 cm. The total number of eggs in a spawning female, 590 mm in total length and 4.9 kg in weight, is nearly 765,000, which is a considerably a high number for the production of fry. 2. In the embryonic and the larval stages, the blood vessels form a network on the yolk sac and fin folds, and are representations of well developed respiratory devices as an adaptation to less favourable conditions. Large secretory cells are marked around the head and the yolk sac of the embryo and the larvae, and last till the yolk absorption. These seem to aid the larvae in sticking to the substratum, which is a natural device of safety against driftng by the current of stagnant water. The first sign of the rudiment of the gut is marked as an endodermal thickening by about 40 hours after fertlization, which assumes a cylindrical form of double layered cells by 70 hours (18 hours before hatching). By 78 hours after hatching a lumen is formed by the retreat of cells rather than the evagination as in other vertebrates (Fig. 5P, R, S, T). The mouth is formed at about 8-10 hours before hatching (Fig. 5 U, V). The liver is formed on the latero-ventral sides of the gut (Fig. 5 T). Pharyngeal folds are marked at 41-45 hours after fertilization as two dorso-lateral endodermal outgrowths which proceed to meet an inwardly pushed layer of ectoderm to form gill slits by 56-57 hours after fertilzation (Fig. 5 Q). Pectoral fins begin their formation at about 55 hours after fertilization and the median fin fold is prominently visible by 70 hours. 3. The period of incubation varies with the temperature (Table 2) and at 13-17℃ the larvae hatch in 90 hours after incubation and measure 3.9-5.6 mm. Hatching is completed wthin 2.5-3.5 days. The yolk sac is completely absorbed in 8 mm. All the fins are marked in 10 mm. The posterior end of the notochord is begining to turn upward in 7.5-7.7 mm larvae. The heterocercal caudal fin starts its formation at 7.5-7.7 mm. Hypurals number 7 (Fig. 10). Scales first appear behind the opercle at 17-18 mm, and cover the entire body surface of the carp by 24-30 mm. Young carp of this length resembles the adult in appearance (Figs. 6, 13). Liver cells start arranging themselves into lobular forms in 4.2 mm larva within 10 hours after hatching. The pancreas is differentiated along the left dorsal side of the intestine as a deeply stained mass of cells among the liver cells by 5.3 mm larva. The gall bladder is marked at this stage (Fig. 7 F, H). The hepato-pancreas assumes the young form by 9.6-10.5 mm. The anlage of the air bladder is marked a few hours before hatching (Fig. 5 W) and becomes to be filled with air by 6 mm (Fig. 7 C) and pushes the first part of intestine. The anterior one is formed in about 10 mm larva. The newly hatched larva begins its active life after the absorption of yolk (i. e., 7-8 mm larva). Active preying habit on the zooplankton is quite prominent by this stage. Schooling behaviour, though, beginning at 9.5 mm, at this stage or even after is not so significant. They start feeding 24-36 hours after hatching. The juvenile and the young prefer to eat at short intervals, which seems to be advantageous for the absence of stomach. The power of discriminating eatable substances appears to be intense. Weberian ossicles are marked by 10.6 mm joining the ear bones anteriorly and the air bladder posteriorly. The longitudinal grooves and fenestrations are formed by 17-18 mm (Fig. 11). 4. The club cells appear at about 12mm larva on the head skin between the upper lip and the nasal cavity and occasionally multinucleate giant cells are marked more along the dorsal side of the head than the ventral one (Fig. 16 E). By 6 mm the dorsal skin of the head shows wrinkles which are the cytoplasmic extensions of the cells. They seem to disappear at 12-13 mm, which is the time of the appearance of club cells at that position. Taste buds first appear on the head skin (between the upper lip and the nasal cavity) at 18 mm. Occasionally, promucous cells like those of the buccal epithelium are observed from the head skin epithelium. A girdle of elongated cells intercepted by collagenous fibres hanging down into the dermis from the basement membrane is observed: this has not been reportd before (Fig. 16 F, G). Mandibular barbels first appear at 18.5 mm in total length and measure about 217 $\mu$, while the maxlilary ones are noticed at 22 mm which is the stage of the appearance of the taste buds on the barbels. Mucous cells and club cells are evidenced abundantly in the proximal or post-proximal regions of the barbels. The epidermis enveloping the anterior side of the nasal flaps is thicker than that of the posterior one. Taste buds are marked from the distal anterior end. Club cells are absent from the middle and the distal region of the flaps (Fig. 19 A-D). The outer epidermis of the operculum appears to be thicker than the inner one and a few taste buds are noted from the outer side only. Conjunctiva of the eye and the caudal fin also possess taste organs in their epidermis (Fig. 20 AF). Their presence on all these organs are suggestive of their wide adaptability to environments. 5. Lips of the young and the adult are provided with low ridges and shallow furrows (Fig. 22) which appear to be helpful during the feeding activity from the bottom. Horny type of dentitions resting upon the membranous structure are marked on the inner posterior side of the lips of the larvae, juveniles and the young ones; these may help in holding the food materials (Fig. 27 C, D). The maxillary valve is marked with the opening of the mouth in the embryonic stage. It is a small, almost cresentic membranous structure hanging freely into the buccal cavity behind the upper lip. In 6.9-6.8 mm larvae the mucosa of the buccal cavity (roof) is marked to enter as a thin Iayer into the proximal of the maxillary valve. Mucous cells are greater and larger on the ventral sides of the valve than the dorsal one. One to 3 typical taste buds born on papillae are recorded only from the ventral surface of the valve, which come in direct touch with food substances (Fig. 27 C, E-G). A few prominent papillary folds marked in the mouth cavity as early as 9-10 mm become regularly to be arranged by 15 mm in total length and 3-4 longitudinal folds are marked from the centre of the buccal cavity (roof). The roof is concave and the floor is slightly convex so as to fit nicely during the food taking. Papillae on the pharyngeal roof are more abundant than those of the buccal one and they decrease posteriorly; on the Aoor, they reach tiI1 the fourth gill arch (Fig. 23 A-F). Mucous cells are almost uniformly distributed in the buccal cavity. Promucous cells and club cells are occasionally marked (Fig. 27 M). Three types of taste buds are recognized from the epithelium of the cavity: buds with truncated, protruding, and depressed apices. Besides lymphocytes, vacuoles or oval cells are occasionally found towards the middle or distal ends of the buds (Fig. 29 E-J). Five developmental stages of the mouth are marked (Fig. 21) in this study which are related to the change of feeding habits. Pharyngeal teeth are apparent in 6.8 mm in total length. In the larvae and the juveniles they are arranged asymmetrically in 3-4 rows totalling 7-8 on each arch. They are curved, serrated, and backwardly directed, which befits the carnivorous feeding habits. They hold the prey tightly and transfer them to the oesophageal cavity. The flatness on the crowns of teeth on the first and second row become apparent by 28 mm (Fig. 24 F), and furrows are established by 45-50 mm in total length. This change of teeth formation is in correlation to the change of food habits from early carnivorous to the omnivorous one. The relative length and the width of the pharyngel arch appears to be greater (i.e., 3-4.26) till about 30 mm in total length after which it nearly becomes on an average of 2.87 (2.2-3.46) by 45-50 mm. The higher value is a characteristic of the carnivores and the lower one of the herbivores (Fig. 25). The horny pad is biconvex and almost four cornered (Fig. 26 C). In the larval stage it is a soft structure but considerable hardness is felt by 28 mm, this becoming quite apparent by 45-50 mm in total length. This appears to be in relation to the development of furrows or grooves on the crowns of the pharyngeal teeth. Hardness of the pad is correlated with more herbivorous habits than carnivorous ones. Well developed taste buds are recognized on the palatal organs and in the tissues of the pharyngeal teeth but the finding of the same in the middle layer of the horny pad seems to be of special significance in the gustatory sensitiveness during the act of feeding (Fig. 26 B, E). Mucous cells are absent from the lips. These cells and the taste buds appear to be related to each other in their distribution in the pharyngeal and oesophageal cavities. The former increases posteriorly and the latter vice versa. The anterior part of the oesophagus is provided with more mucous},

@article{Hedgecock1994,
abstract = {Allozyme variation at ten polymorphic loci is reported for a total of 2,628 northern anchovies from 32 midwater trawl samples of the central stock taken by the CalCOFI spawning biomass survey cruises of December 1982, and the winters of 1983, 1984, and 1985. Frequencies of genotypes at these loci conform to those expected on the basis of random mating, according to the Hardy-Weinberg (HW) principle and goodness-of-fit tests. Yet goodness-of-fit tests have low power for detecting failure of the HW principle or its assumptions and are here contradicted by evidence for significant heterogeneity of allelic frequencies among stations within years and within the total sample. Wright's F-ST statistics a relative measure of allele-frequency variance among stations that ranges from 0.005 to 0.020, indicates little differentiation and relatively high gene now among stations. Absolute total variance of allelic frequency among stations, however, is twice as large as the binomial sampling variance for a single, randomly mating population. Moreover, chi-square contingency tests of allele-frequency homogeneity among stations are highly significant over all loci for each of the four years. These results falsify the hypothesis that the central stock is a randomly mating population. Several lines of evidence suggest that the genetic heterogeneity of the central stock is geographically unpatterned, or ''chaotic,'' giving no indication of spatially distinct panmictic units. The loci that contribute to heterogeneity differ from year to year. Allelic frequencies are correlated weakly or not at all with latitude (CalCOFI line coordinate) or distance offshore. Spatial autocorrelation of allelic frequencies is weak among age subsamples within stations and declines to nonsignificant levels within 100 km. Correlations among genotypes at different loci, which can be nonzero in mixtures of genetically differentiated populations, are not significantly different from zero. Finally, cluster analysis of genetic distances among all 32 stations joins samples from different years and disparate latitudes at high levels of similarity. Variation in allelic frequencies is significantly correlated with morphometric variation but not with measures of condition or reproductive state, suggesting that observed genetic heterogeneity is associated with substantial, perhaps heritable, morphological variation within the central stock. Genetic and morphometric variance may be generated by processes governing reproductive success, larval survival, and recruitment to first schools. How this variance is maintained through the adult stages is a matter for speculation, but it does permit natural selection to act among groups as well as among individuals.},

abstract = {In the present study, we developed a larval anchovy growth model in relation to sea temperature and food availability via food consumption and metabolic process terms, based on biological data from previous laboratory experiments and field surveys from 2003 to 2006 in Hiuchi-nada Sea, central part of Seto Inland Sea, Japan. To investigate when food shortage for larval anchovy and then recruitment failure occur in Hiuchi-nada Sea, anchovy food requirements were estimated by using the growth model, and we compared the food requirement with anchovy food availability. We applied an estimation method for growth model parameters, Hewett-Johnson p and Q (10), by minimizing the sum of squares of difference between mass-specific growth rates estimated by the models and those by otolith growth analysis. Parameter p was 0.86, slightly higher than typical values, and Q (10) was 2.11, close to the value used for the biological model of larval northern anchovy. Food shortage for anchovy larvae did not occur in Hiuchi-nada Sea, although it was indicated that low food availability led to a low reproductive success rate. The newly developed growth model is considered optimal at present and useful to link environmental conditions and larval growth.},

abstract = {Egg and larval abundance, obtained from annual summer cruises carried out in the Strait of Sicily during 6 years (1997 to 2002), was used to identify the spawning and retention areas of the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus. Larval amino acid composition was used to analyse the nutritional condition of the larvae collected during the 2002 survey. As the anchovy spawns along the south Sicilian coast, but mainly in the north-west and middle parts of the coast, the higher number and larger size larvae in the south-east end of the Sicilian coast indicated that larvae were transported by the main branch of the Atlantic-Ionian Stream and retained in the south-east end of the Sicilian coast (Cape Passero). This retention process, however, did not always favour the nutritional condition of the larvae, because the larvae were not transported to an area with a higher primary production or with a higher stability. In 2002 larval amino acid concentration was higher in the spawning areas than in those areas where the larvae were transported to, indicating a lower nutritional condition of the larvae in the nursery areas. The lack of enrichment and concentration processes, and low primary production in this area which limited body growth rate may explain the low locally reproducing anchovy population in the south coast of Sicily.

abstract = {In upwelling ecosystems, there is often a crucial intermediate trophic level, occupied by small, plankton-feeding pelagic fish dominated by one or a few schooling species. Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa. Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level "wasp-waist" populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individuals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a "school trap" that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) population ill the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

Otolith readings were calibrated by comparing light microscope readings with scanning electron microscope readings. Different growth models were applied to describe the growth of larvae between 8 and 35 mm TL (total length): a linear function, a power function, a modified power. function with estimation of L-0, and the Laird-Gompertz function. The parameters of the Laird-Gompertz model were estimated as: L-0 = 2.72 mm, L-infinity = 60.5 mm, G = 0.041, a = 3.1, t(0) = 27.5 d. Daily growth rates, retrieved from the different models, vary between 0.65 and 0.99 mm for the size range investigated. Growth at different stations was compared by the slope of linear regressions and the exponents of the power functions. Offshore stations were generally found to show higher growth rates than inshore stations. At least three spawning cohorts were separated geographically: One offshore, one nearshore and a possible one in the southern parr of the investigation area.},

The red and pink fibres were multi-innervated whereas the white fibres were terminally innervated. The relative proportion of the red muscle increased toward the caudal region, the white muscle diminished toward that region, whereas the proportion of pink muscle did not vary according to region, being scarce throughout.

abstract = {Spawning frequency of offshore migrant populations of Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus ranged from 0. 34 to 0.90, and was higher than that of inshore Japanese anchovy. In addition, spawning frequency of offshore populations varied in response to the sex ratio. They spawned at water temperatures of 5.0, 8.6 and 12.6degrees C, indicating that the minimum critical water temperature of offshore Japanese anchovy was considerably lower than that of inshore populations. A significant positive relationship was observed between water temperature and relative batch fecundity of offshore Japanese anchovy. Furthermore, water temperature was negatively related to egg size, suggesting a trade-off between relative batch fecundity and egg size for offshore fish. At the same water temperature, relative batch fecundity of offshore populations was higher than that of inshore ones. The comparison of spawning frequency and relative batch fecundity suggests that offshore Japanese anchovy represent a reproductive ecology by which they spawn more eggs than inshore Japanese anchovy within a certain time period.

abstract = {Data from two ichthyoplankton surveys carried out during June 1995 and June 1996 were used to study the broad scale distribution patterns of anchovy eggs and larvae over the northern Aegean Sea continental shelf and the regional/inter-annual variability in growth and mortality rates of larvae. Two major spawning grounds were identified. One in the east, located in the area influenced by the Samothraki gyre (SG), in which a large amount of enriched, modified Black Sea water (BSW) is entrapped and one in the west, associated with zooplankton-rich waters in the semi-enclosed Thermaikos gulf close to several river mouths. In the NE Aegean, anticyclonic gyres generated over the continental shelf and fed by the circulating stream of BSW (like the SG) may act as retention areas for larval anchovy. In the west, the high enclosure of the Thermaikos Gulf contributes to reducing offshore dispersal. Major changes were observed in egg and larval abundance as well as larval mortality between June 1995 and June 1996 in both the western and eastern part of the continental shelf. Mean abundance of eggs and early larvae was {\textgreater} 5 times higher in 1996 than in 1995, when waters were significantly cooler, fresher and richer in mesozooplankton. Larval survival decreased from 79 to 69{\%} day(-1) in the east and from 89 to 74{\%} day(-1) in the west between 1995 and 1996. Hence increased egg production was coupled with higher larval mortality during June 1996. Furthermore, a highly significant positive relationship between larval mortality (Z) and mean egg abundance (A) emerged (Z = -0154 + 0.205 log[A], r(2) s= 0.96, n = 7) when data from this study and a similar study in the NW Mediterranean were regressed. Mean growth rate of anchovy larvae in the study area (similar to 0.5 mm day(-1)) did not differ significantly between areas/years. A marked ontogenetic change was observed in the otolith size/recent otolith growth-on-fish size relationships, which exhibited significant inflection points at similar to 6 mm formalin preserved length. This change seems to coincide with performance (e.g., catchability) and behavioral changes (e.g., onset of vertical migrations) in European anchovy associated with the development of the caudal fin (the flexion stage).},

Annuli in otolith sections were validated by means of marginal increment analyses and fluorochrome marking (oxytetracycline). Maximum ages recorded were 12 and 16 years at Kosi Bay and De Hoop respectively. Kosi Bay fish obtained a significantly greater asymptotic length than De Hoop fish and mean length-at-age (for ages 2-10 years) was significantly greater. The fitted von Bertalanffy growth equations for combined sexes were: L(t) = 594 (1 - e(-0.183(t+2.42))) for De Hoop and L(t) = 875 (1 - e(-0.151(t+2.49))) for Kosi Bay. Trends in mean monthly gonadosomatic indices and proportions of histologically validated macroscopic gonad stages indicated a summer spawning season (November-February) at De Hoop and year-round spawning at Kosi Bay. Relative condition peaked in both spring and autumn at De Hoop but showed little seasonal variation in the Kosi Bay region. Kosi Bay females attained 50{\%} sexual maturity at a significantly larger size (48 vs 39 cm) but at younger age (2.8 vs 3.4 years) than those at De Hoop. Analysis of maturity schedules indicates that current sizes at maturity are plastic responses that maximise lifetime fecundity within local regimes of somatic growth and natural mortality. The instantaneous rate of natural mortality was substantially higher at Kosi Bay than at De Hoop (M = 0.35 vs M = 0.26).},

For each year (1993 excluded), 150 settling individuals were selected and used for reconstruction of larval stage duration based on otolith daily ring counts. In addition, prevailing water temperature conditions during drift as revealed from NOAA satellite images were determined. Mean larval stage duration varied between about 40 and 60 d, without any clear significant pattern between or within years. Year-class strength of plaice in the western Wadden Sea was not related to mean larval stage duration. Mean larval stage duration did not show a clear pattern during the period of immigration, nor with reconstructed temperature conditions. The observed decrease of larval stage duration with temperature in the field was lower than that observed under laboratory conditions, suggesting food limitation with increasing temperature during drift. The fact that both within-year and for all years combined the number of immigrating larvae was inversely related to temperature conditions during drift suggested that year-class strength could be affected by temperature-mediated predation, but simultaneously occurring food limitation at high temperatures cannot be excluded.},

Mean daily consumption in the field was estimated at 3.45 {\%} of body wt d-1. Since the various food types available to anchovy differ in their caloric values, this figure might be expected to vary according to the type of diet available to the fish. To obtain a diet energetically equivalent to that measured in the field anchovy feeding exclusively on phytoplankton would need to consume the equivalent of 5.8{\%} of their body wt d-1 and those feeding on zooplankton 3.5 to 4.5 {\%} of the body wt, while fish feeding on their own eggs would require only 2.5{\%} of their body wt daily. Feeding on eggs at peak spawning on the spawning grounds - where there is limited alternative food (i.e., zooplankton) available - seems adequate to support reproduction.

@article{Nakata2000,
abstract = {In the mid 1970s, the fishery catch of postlarval Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonica) in a shelf region of the Enshu-nada Sea, off the central Pacific coast of Japan, started to decline corresponding to a rapid increase of postlarval sardine (Sardinops melanostictus). In late 1980s, sardine started to decline, and it was replaced by anchovy in the 1990s. This alternating dominance of postlarval sardine and anchovy corresponded to the alternation in egg abundance of these two species in the spawning habitat of this sea. It was also noteworthy that during the period of sardine decline, sardine spawning occurred in April-May, a delay of two months compared with spawning in the late 1970s. The implication of oceanographic changes in the spawning habitat for the alternating dominance of sardine and anchovy eggs was explored using time-series data obtained in 1975-1998, focusing on the effect of the Kuroshio meander. Large meanders of the Kuroshio may have enhanced the onshore intrusion of the warm water into the shelf region and contributed to an increase in temperature in the spawning habitat. This might favour sardine, because its egg abundance in the shelf region was more dependent on the temperature in early spring than was that of anchovy. In addition, enhanced onshore intrusion could contribute to transport of sardine larvae from upstream spawning grounds of the Kuroshio region. On the other hand, anchovy egg abundance was more closely related to lower transparency at the shelf edge, which may indicate the prevalence and prolonged residence of the coastal water, and therefore higher food availability, frequently accompanying non-meandering Kuroshio. The expansion/shrinkage of the spawning habitat of sardine and anchovy in the shelf region, apparently responding to the change in the Kuroshio, possibly makes the alternation in dominance of postlarval sardine and anchovy most prominent in the Enshu-nada Sea, in combination with changes in the abundance of spawning adults, which occurred almost simultaneously in the overall Kuroshio region. The implication of this rather regional feature for the alternating dominance of sardine and anchovy populations on a larger spatial scale is also discussed.},

abstract = {In this study, we review the relationship between female size and spawning frequency using information from Sardinops sagax and Engraulis ringens, two species which are important for the economy of countries located in the Humboldt Current System. We test the hypothesis that spawning frequency is positively related to female size using information for these two species in northern Chile. The data analyzed were obtained from four different sources: (a) reproductive information obtained from the application of the Daily Egg Production Method (DEPM) in E. ringens between 1992 and 2005; (b) adult reproductive parameters for different species of the genus Engraulis; (c) spawns counts for a brood stock of E. ringens reared in captivity; (c) results from an indirect method based on a gonadosomatic calibrated index developed for S. sagax utilizing data obtained from 1974 to 1996. An analysis of the 11-year DEPM data series for E. ringens suggest that the daily spawning fraction also increases with the average weight of mature anchovy females and that such relationship may also be described using an asymptotic model. A plot of the daily spawning fraction and average female weight data obtained from results of DEPM applications for different Engraulis species from around the world also showed a positive correlation, suggesting that this relationship may be valid for many species, even those located in different habitats. An analysis of the data obtained from the E. ringens brood experiments showed that the number of eggs spawned in the tank increased monthly as female age increased, even though the number of females decreased due to natural mortality. Results in S. sagax females showed that smaller females have shorter spawning periods and a lower spawning fraction; accordingly, bigger females spawned more frequently than smaller ones. The long term estimation (1974-1996) of spawning numbers in relation to S. sagax female size was well described by a sigmoid function. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In rearing studies on 6- to 22-d-old larval striped bass, Morone saxatilis, we applied several back-calculation methods to known-growth larvae. A growth effect occurred on otolith diameter - standard length relationships, where slower growing larvae had relatively larger otoliths. Otolith growth was less affected by feeding regime than was somatic growth. Due to the conservative nature of otolith growth, proportional based (Biological Intercept Method) and simple linear regression methods linearized somatic growth transitions and did not estimate periods of negative growth. A quadratic regression method which used age as an additional predictor resulted in the accurate back-calculation of size at age in all groups of laboratory-reared larvae. However, when model coefficients were applied to a test population of pond-reared larvae, the quadratic model performed poorly. While differences in relative otolith size between pond- and laboratory-reared larvae could be ascribed to a temperature effect, the inability to apply the model also indicates a problem specific to regression-based methods. Theoretical rationale and experimental proof provided evidence for the inclusion of age in back-calculation models, but parameterization will have to occur for each field application.},

abstract = {The performance of five back-calculation (B-C) models was tested with individually tagged and multiple alizarin-marked Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) reared at seasonally varying water temperature and food regimes over a 10-month period. The otoliths were transversely sectioned and the otolith growth between marks was measured along the dorsal, distal, and ventral radii and across the otolith width. Observed fish lengths at each marking time were compared with back-calculated lengths using linear and nonlinear scale and body proportional hypotheses (SPII and BPII) and biological intercept (BI) models. Measurements along the dorsal and distal radius with SPH and BI provided more accurate fish length estimates but with lower precision, whereas measurements of the ventral radius consistently produced greater overestimations by any model. Otolith width measurements produced moderately overestimated fish length estimates but with the highest precision and were significantly affected by temperature in all models. Certain combinations of model and otolith dimension were more sensitive to the length of the back-calculation time interval, whereas varying feeding regime induced temporary biases only. The selection of B-C model and otolith dimension thus depends not only on the environmental conditions that the fish experience, but also on the requirements of the application for which the B-C is used.},

Discriminant function analysis of both morphometric and meristic characters indicated the existence of four morphologically differentiated groups of E. encrasicolus. The Aegean Sea and Marmara Sea samples were the most isolated from all others for morphometric and meristic characters. Genetic analyses indicated great variability but suggested low levels of differentiation in the eastern Black Sea samples. However, the low genetic distance between this and other samples suggests the existence of hybridization between the Azov and eastern Black Sea populations. Nonetheless, genetic analysis showed that these levels were significant and the population structure should be analysed using markers able to detect a greater degree of population differentiation.},

Anchovy larvae were reared for up to 9 days after the first-feeding day at 20degreesC and 25degreesC under various feeding conditions. Percent survival of the group starved for 2 days after the first-feeding day was extremely lower than that of those fed from the first-feeding day and 1 day starved groups at the two temperatures, even if they were supplied with food thereafter. Therefore it was concluded that the point of no return (PNR) was between 1 and 2 days after the first-feeding day within this temperature range. The RNA:DNA ratio of the PNR criterion was determined. Also, a 0{\%} growth formula was established representing the relationship between the daily growth rate in protein, RNA:DNA ratio and temperature for first-feeding larvae.},

Characiformes, Tetraodontiformes and Siluriformes were found in the ichthyoplankton mostly during the rising waters, but Clupeiformes and Sciaenidae drifted in the river almost all year around. Egg abundance was extremely low, suggesting that they do not drift or have a very short residence time. Two types of larval drift seemed to occur: a rising water drift and a lowering water drift. Characiformes, Tetraodontiformes and some Clupeiformes drifted mostly during the rising waters and were more abundant near the banks. Their strategy seemed to be a passive dispersion towards the floodplain with the flood pulse. The high densities near the banks optimized their chances of reaching a floodplain inlet. The groups that drifted during the lowering waters showed an alternative strategy. They were flushed from the floodplain lakes and may have stayed in the main river channel for a few months before returning to the floodplain. Predation in the lakes during the period when water level decline was probably the force behind this drift. (C) 1998 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {The distribution, abundance and population structure of pilchard, round herring and anchovy off the east coast of southern Africa were investigated during hydroacoustic and midwater trawl surveys in August 1986, June 1987 and June 1990. The 1986 survey revealed the distribution of the three species to be almost continuous between Cape Town and East London, with about 13 per cent of the pilchard, 21 per cent of the round herring and 4 per cent of the anchovy biomass east of Cape Town occurring on the East Coast. Abundance and distribution of pelagic fish off the East Coast was similar in 1986 and 1987. All three species spawn off the East Coast Few temperate pelagic fish were detected off the Natal coast during either the 1986 or 1987 surveys, but during June 1990, pelagic fish targets, thought to have been mainly temperate clupeoids, were encountered over most of the shelf from East London to some 70 nautical miles north-east of Port St Johns, and along the shelf-edge in the vicinity of Port Shepstone. During all three surveys, pelagic fish in the vicinity of Port St Johns had descended into the cool water underlying the Agulhas Current It is proposed that the annual "sardine run" off Natal is a phenomenon arising from an expansion of pilchard habitat during the cooler conditions that prevail during winter. The expansion brings the fish east into Transkei waters at roughly the same time each year. Phenomena such as current reversals, upwelling of cool water onto the narrow shelf or even pursuit by predators then results in "leakage" of schools along the shelf between Port St Johns and Durban.},

@article{Voss2012,
abstract = {The GLOBEC Germany program (2002-2007) had the ambitious goal to resolve the processes impacting the recruitment dynamics of Baltic sprat (Sprattus sprattus L.) by examining various factors affecting early life history stages. At the start of the research program, a number of general recruitment hypotheses were formulated, i.e. focusing on (1) predation, (2) food availability, (3) physical parameters, (4) the impact of current systems, and finally (5) the importance of top-clown vs bottom-up effects. The present study synthesizes the results of field sampling (2002 and 2003), laboratory experiments, and modeling studies to re-evaluate these hypotheses for the Baltic sprat stock. Recruitment success was quite different in the 2 years investigated. Despite a lower spawning stock biomass in 2003, the total number of recruits was almost 2-fold higher that year compared to 2002. The higher recruitment success in 2003 could be attributed to enhanced survival success during the post-larval/juvenile stage, a life phase that appears to be critical for recruitment dynamics. In the state of the Baltic ecosystem during the period of investigation, we consider bottom-up control (e.g. temperature, prey abundance) to be more important than top-down control (predation mortality). This ranking in importance does not vary seasonally. Prevailing water circulation patterns and the transport dynamics of larval cohorts have a strong influence on sprat recruitment success. Pronounced transport to coastal areas is detrimental for year-class strength particularly at high sprat stock sizes. A suggested mechanism is density-dependant regulation of survival via intra- and inter-specific competition for prey in coastal areas. A documented change in larval vertical migration behavior between the early 1990s and early 2000s increased the transport potential to the coast, strengthening the coupling between inter-annual differences in the magnitude and direction of wind-driven surface currents and year-to-year changes in reproductive success. However, due to the strong linkages and feed-back loops in the Baltic Sea food web, the most robust projections of the future strength of the Baltic sprat stock will need to take into account climate-driven changes in both abiotic (e.g., drift trajectories) and biotic (trophodynamic) factors. Although our understanding of processes affecting pre-recruit (larval) growth and survival has been advanced by the integrated research conducted within the GLOBEC Germany program, key mechanisms potentially affecting life stages outside of the spawning basins remain to be explored including the dynamics of coastal habitats of juveniles and the feeding and overwintering grounds of adults.

For the years 2001 and 2003. 1 year-old individuals were dominant, whereas for the year 2002 they were less common in contrast 2 year-old individuals represented 74{\%} of the total individuals, suggesting that the fisheries in 2002 were mainly Supported by the strong recruitment of 2000. The classification success of the discriminant analysis indicated a strong separation between year-groups (P {\textless} 0.001), overall, 98{\%} of individuals were correctly classified. Results front both jackknife and Cohen's kappa procedures confirmed the high rates of classification success obtained by the discriminant analysis (99 and 97{\%} respectively). Stability in the intraannual shape analysis leads to the idea that individuals were affected by the same intraannual environmental conditions in the Bay of Biscay. Variability in the interaannual shape analysis could indicate that the spawning population is composed of European anchovy from different origins every year. In general differences observed suggested that the European anchovy in the Bay of Biscay were members of three or more different communities or entities.

Variation in size and growth of West Greenland capelin (Mallotus villosus) along latitudinal gradients. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1128-1137. Capelin (Mallotus villosus) is the dominant pelagic species in the West Greenland ecosystem. Historical data are re- examined and new data are presented on the size distribution and the growth pattern of capelin along latitudinal gradients of temperature and other growth factors extending over a distance of 1300 km. The average size of capelin increases with latitude. Fish 3 years old were 48 mm larger (54{\%}) at the secondmost northern station compared with the most southern one. Otolith analysis revealed a significant effect of age as well as area on back- calculated growth. Hence, at all ages, fish grew faster in the north than in the south. Average somatic growth across areas in the first and fourth years was 56 and 15 mm, respectively. Temperature data suggest a 2 degrees C difference in temperature between areas, temperatures being warmest in the north. Hence, the increase in temperature with latitude explains much of the latitudinal growth gradient and suggests a growth difference in West Greenland capelin of 0.4- 0.6 cm degrees C(-1) year(-1). However, the difference in growth and size distribution between northern and southernmost stations, where temperatures are similar, suggests that other factors, such as differences in available prey and diet composition, also contribute to the differences.},

Representative samples from each ration level were taken in 10-day intervals between Day 0 and Day 30 for evaluation of direct and indirect growth measures. Positive correlations were observed between ration levels, somatic growth, and otolith growth. Statistical differences in weight and length of red drum were observed among ration levels by Days 10 and 20, respectively. Statistical differences for measures of otolith growth among ration levels were evident by Days 20 and 30. In addition, RNA/DNA ratios showed clear separation between fish that were starved and fish that were fed but demonstrated minimal separation among ration levels. Overall, the combination of a measure of somatic growth (weight) and a measure of otolith growth (otolith weight) resulted in the most statistical separation among ration levels. Findings from this study suggest that somatic growth, otolith growth and RNA/DNA ratios are suitable measures of relative growth of red drum; however, due to differences in sensitivity, caution must be exercised when using indirect growth (otolith growth, RNA/DNA ratios) measures to estimate recent growth.

@article{Hernandez2000,
abstract = {Larval growth rates of the anchoveta Engraulis ringens were determined for two periods during the winter spawning season off Talcahuano, central Chile. Because winter is the season of minimum plankton production during the year, we hypothesized that larval growth rates during winter should be constantly low because of decreased larval fish food availability. Our results, however, indicate that 1) mean larval growth rates determined from three growth models in winter (mid-July through mid-September) were as high as in other periods of the year (linear, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy; 0.47 mm/d, 0.50 mm/d, and 0.48 mm/d, repectively); 2) differences in larval growth rates occurred in two groups of cohorts spawned in the two periods during the spawning season (0.40 mm/d vs. 0.57 mm/d); and, 3) larval food (dinoflagellates, copepod eggs, and copepod nauplii) concentrations in the field were relatively high and not very variable during the study. Hydrography of the water column, however varied throughout the season. During the last weeks of the study seawater temperature was higher, indicating intrusion of offshore warmer waters into the coastal zone. The presence of these warmer waters suggests that differences in growth rates between groups of cohorts may have resulted from larval development in water with different characteristics. Consequently, for a coastal upwelling species such as the anchoveta, increased growth rates in some cohorts may be advantageous considering that its main spawning season occurs in winter when the environmental conditions fluctuate markedly in short, time scales.},

abstract = {The impact of the El Nino event (1997-1998) on the spatial dynamics as well as on the changes in the aggregation patterns of anchoveta eggs and larvae due to the alteration in the thermal anomalies were analyzed. Six bio-oceanographic surveys were carried out in northern Chile from Arica (18 degrees 29'S, 70 degrees 19'W) to Antofagasta (23 degrees 38'S, 70 degrees 24'W) over different periods (before and during) of the 1997-1998 El Nino event. Changes in the vertical distribution and aggregation patterns of anchoveta in early life stages were registered as well as an increase in zooplankton biomass with the arrival of El Nino; moreover, the spatial distribution of anchoveta was altered due to the gradually poleward displacement of spawning areas as a result of the arrival of subtropical warm waters from the north. The increase in zooplankton biomass linked to a change in the species composition suggests a negative impact on the anchoveta larval feeding. Our results suggest that abrupt changes in the environment would have immediate consequences on the spatial distribution of anchoveta in early life stages, causing a potential impact on the recruitment of this small pelagic fish in the Humboldt Current System off northern Chile.},

Geographical distribution patterns and relationships with temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, and zooplankton abundance indicated that the anchovy population was mainly spawning in the East China Sea shelf water influenced by the Yangtze River, while the hairtail population was spawning in the warm Kuroshio Current and the zone in which it mixed with the East China Sea shelf water. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index increased in the summer of 1997 and decreased in the summer of 1998, with two peaks in August 1997 and March 1998. High densities of anchovy eggs and larvae were observed in areas of low salinity following heavy rains around the Yangtze River in May and August 1998 (after El Nino). This suggested that the mechanism of ENSO's connections is through the influence of water from the Yangtze River which can affect the productivity in the spawning grounds and the extension of nursery grounds eastward into the East China Sea.

abstract = {Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) eggs exhibited different spatial structure on the scale of 0.75-2.5 km in two egg patches sampled in the Southern California Bight in April 2000. Plankton samples were collected at 4-min intervals with a Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES) on 5 x 5 km grids centered on surface drifters. Variograms were calculated for sardine and anchovy eggs in Lagrangian coordinates, using abundances of individual developmental stages grouped into daily cohorts. Model variograms for sardine eggs have a low nugget effect, about 10{\%} of the total variance, indicating high autocorrelation between adjacent samples. In contrast, model variograms for anchovy eggs have a high nugget effect of 50-100{\%}, indicating that most of the variance at the scales sampled is spatially unstructured. The difference between observed spatial patterns of sardine and anchovy eggs on this scale may reflect the behavior of the spawning adults: larger, faster, more abundant fish may organize into larger schools with greater structure and mobility that create smoother egg distributions. Size and mobility vary with population size in clupeoids. The current high abundance of sardines and low abundance of anchovy off California agree with the greater autocorrelation of sardine egg samples and the observed tendency for locations of anchovy spawning to be more persistent on the temporal scale of days to weeks. Thus the spatial pattern of eggs and the persistence of spawning areas are suggested to depend on species, population size and age structure, spawning intensity and characteristic physical scales of the spawning habitat.},

abstract = {In September 1991, water fowl died in Monterey Bay, CA, after eating anchovies (Engraulis mordax) contaminated with domoic acid. Analysis revealed that the anchovies contained up to 485 ppm domoic acid in their viscera. This was the first reported incidence of domoic acid-related mortality of any organism in the United States. After this reported outbreak we obtained frozen samples of anchovies that were harvested near Newport, CA, in April 1991 and found they contained 270 ppm domoic acid in their viscera. By May, average domoic acid levels in frozen anchovy samples from this same area were less than 1 ppm. In October 1991, domoic acid was detected in razor clams (Siliqua patula) from Oregon and Washington and appeared to peak (an average of 106 ppm for all Washington State beaches) in the first week of December 1991. The averages then declined to less than 20 ppm without 6 months. However, domoic acid was still present at low levels (averages {\textless}5 ppm) in razor clams from Washington state beaches in December 1993. Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) in Washington and Oregon were also found to contain domoic acid, but only in their viscera. Domoic acid concentrations in the raw viscera of individual crabs from Washington state in December 1991 averaged 13 ppm and ranged from 0.8 to 90 ppm. The highest average levels of domoic acid in Washington state crabs were in the Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay samples, 32 and 31 ppm, respectively. By 1992 domoic acid level averages were {\textless}5 ppm in preseason samples of Dungeness crab taken along the Oregon and Washington coasts, ranging from 0 to 71 ppm. The highest levels of domoic acid in 1992 (36-71 ppm) were recorded in samples taken early in that year (January through April).},

abstract = {Extensive plankton collections were taken during seven September cruises (1990-93) along the inner continental shelf of the northcentral Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Despite the high productivity and availability of food during these cruises, significant smallscale spatial variability was found in larval growth rates for both Atlantic bumper (Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Carangidae) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens, Lutjanidae). The observed variability in larval growth rates was not correlated with changes in water temperature or associated with conspicuous hydrographic features and suggested the existence of less-recognizable regions where conditions for growth vary. Cruise estimates of mortality coefficients (Z) for larval Atlantic bumper (n=32,241 larvae from six cruises) and vermilion snapper (n= 2581 larvae from four cruises) ranged from 0.20 to 0.37 and 0.19 to 0.29, respectively. Even in a subtropical climate like the GOM, where larval-stage durations may be as short as two weeks, observed variability in growth rates, particularly when combined with small changes in mortality rates, can cause order-of-magnitude differences in cumulative larval survival. To what extent the observed differences in growth rates at small spatial scales are fine-scale "noise" that ultimately is smoothed by larger-scale processes is not known. Future research is needed to further characterize the small-scale variability in growth rates of larvae, particularly with regard to microzooplankton patchiness and the temporal and spatial pattern of potential predators. Small-scale spatial variability in larval growth rates may in fact be the norm, and understanding the implications of this subtle mosaic may help us to better evaluate our ability to partition the causes of recruitment variability.},

The optimal temperature and pH of rLAP II were 55 degrees C and 8.0 in phosphate buffer, and its activity was strongly stimulated by Co(2+). Conformational studies indicated that maintaining the alpha-helical structure had a critical effect on rLAP II activity. rLAP II was used to hydrolyze anchovy proteins, and it exhibited high specificity for peptides with molecular weight between 6000 and 1000 Da and positive coordination with endogenous enzymes and commercial Flavourzyme. Its use will enhance protein hydrolysis in species of aquatic animals. rLAP II could potentially be used to remove bitterness in the protein hydrolysis industry.},

Anchovies caught in the southern surveys (40-45 degrees S) ingested less food, whereby the main items were copepods and appendicularians. Plankton samples collected simultaneously with the fishing trawls were also analyzed. Except for Fritillaria borealis, which occurred only in plankton samples, the same appendicularian species (Oikopleura dioica and O. fusiformis) were found in both stomach contents and in plankton samples.

abstract = {Decade-scale regimes of sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis spp. have been observed in the productive coastal waters of the North-Western, North-Eastern and South-Eastern Pacific and the South-Eastern Atlantic. In each of these systems, the two genera fluctuate out of phase with each other. The subdominant genus may initiate a recovery while the other species is still abundant, so population growth is not necessarily a response to a vacant niche. Rather, it appears to be triggered by formation of one or a few powerful year-classes. At high population levels, quality of sardine and their eggs decreased in Japan, leading to decreased production and survival of eggs, poor year-classes and stock collapse. Excessive fishing of strong year-classes early in the recovery stage may prevent a species from assuming dominance, so influencing the natural succession of species. This may greatly alter the structure and functioning of an ecosystem. For example, a mesopelagic forage fish may replace an epipelagic one, with severe repercussions for predators that can only feed in the upper ocean, e.g. some seabirds. Biological factors also may influence the succession of forage fish. For example, off California, peaks in abundance of predatory species such as bonita Sarda, and chub mackerel Scomber, separate those of the planktivorous sardine and anchovy. In the Pacific Ocean, sardine distribution has change greatly. Compared with its range when scarce, a population at a high level of biomass can extend 1 000-1 800 miles farther along the coast and 400-2 200 miles farther out to sea. In different periods of high biomass, sardine did not always have the same distribution. in the 1930s and 1940s, near simultaneous fluctuations of sardine in the North-Western and North-Eastern Pacific were in phase. In the 1980s and 1990s, sardine in the North-Western and South-Eastern Pacific were fluctuating in phase. However. along the west coast of North America, sardine started their most recent increase later than in other regions of the Pacific Ocean. This increase is continuing, whereas sardine populations in the North-Western and South-Eastern Pacific have decreased both in catch and geographic distribution since the late 1980s. Therefore, the North-Eastern Pacific has moved out of phase with other major Pacific sardine populations. This may be because abundance of sardine in the California Current has not get reached a level at which density-dependent effects exert a major influence. Sardine and anchovy in the South-Eastern Atlantic have been out of phase with populations in the Pacific Ocean, especially those off Peru and Chile. Over the last 300 years, episodic fisheries for Bohuslan herring Clupea harengus in Sweden coincide with periods of high anchovy abundance off California. Near simultaneous fluctuations of fish stocks in widely separated regions support the view that they are sometimes influenced by climate operating at a global scale. Changes of the the gyre-scale circulation seem to be major factors in the decadal climate. In Australia, sardine have a wide range, but the less productive waters support a much lower biomass than is found in the other four systems. Engraulis occur in some systems from which Sardinops are absent, for example, Brazil, where they and Sardinella are segregated vertically in the water column.},

abstract = {In the Bay of Biscay, anchovy juveniles are regularly observed off the shelf whereas spawning occurs over the shelf, mainly in the river plumes. This distribution of the juveniles can be interpreted as advective losses of the population recruiting over the shelf. However, recent research suggests an alternative interpretation based on the possibility of the population exploiting the off the shelf waters for recruitment through a loophole of lower predation. In this article, we test this second hypothesis through a review of the information available about different processes in the Bay of Biscay (anchovy distribution, size at age spatial differences, recruitment timing and spatial distribution and potential predators distribution). We also develop a model to explore recruitment success when predation risk is positively correlated with feeding opportunities. We conclude that the hypothesis of anchovy using off-shore (oceanic) waters as a spatial loophole for recruitment cannot be excluded. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Attention to genetic and ecological perspectives can enhance strategies for using fishery resources sustainably. A potentially important application is the use of molecular markers to assess the genetic stock structure of a harvested species. In this study, seven microsatellite markers were analysed in anchovy samples from the Bay of Biscay, the Gulf of Cadiz, and the Gulf of Lions to assess the genetic structure of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) populations in the Bay of Biscay and to infer the biogeographic origin of these populations. All samples showed a deficit of heterozygotes that could be explained by non-random mating, Wahlund's effect, and especially by the presence of null alleles. Global FST and RST values, uncorrected and corrected for null alleles, were significant. There was significant genetic heterogeneity between two populations in the Bay of Biscay, suggesting that anchovy there may not be panmictic. Moreover, the results reinforce the hypothesis of a recent common ancestor shared by Bay of Biscay and western Mediterranean anchovy. These results, together with those of earlier studies, suggest merit in further investigating spatio-temporal genetic variation among anchovy populations in the Northeastern Atlantic.},

Our results show a mixed diet initially dominated by phytoplankton and later switching to zooplankton in older larvae. While larval anchoveta grows, they feed on preys whose widths do not vary much compared to their body length and volume. These preys might be different taxa or a single species whose body widths vary little among life stages (i.e. nauplii and copepodites). Differences in estimated carbon content were observed among food items and a marked increase in carbon consumption was observed in the larger larval sizes ({\textgreater}9 mm standard length). These ontogenetic changes in feeding are coincident with the increased proportion of larger preys and also with the number of preys consumed by larger larvae.},

abstract = {The morphology, fine structure and spectral sensitivity of retinal photoreceptors of two anchovy species were investigated using light and electron microscopy and microspectrophotometry. Distinct regional specialisation of cones was observed. Long and short (bilobed) cones were observed in the horizontal retinal belt, including the nasal and temporal retinal zones. Only triple cones with two long lateral components, one small central component were observed in the dorsal and ventro-nasal retinal regions. The long cones presented various lamellar organisation patterns: (1) in parallel along the cell axis in the central retina, (2) oriented transversely at the base of the outer segment, and (3) tilted longitudinally while extending to the tip of the cone in the retinal periphery. In the short cones, the lamellae were always oriented along the cell axis, and their planes were perpendicular to the lamellae in the long cones, providing a structural basis for the detection of polarisation of incident light. The lamellae in all the outer segments of the triple cones are arranged perpendicular to the long cell axis. In both species, the long and short cones from the ventro-temporal retina were slender and more densely packed, and the outer segments of the long cones lay far more sclerad compared with the outer segments of the bifid cones. Microspectrophotometry revealed that in both species the lateral components of the triple cones displayed a maximum absorbance wavelength (lambda(max)) of approximately 502 nm, while the short central components were more shortwave sensitive (lambda(max) = 475 nm). The lambda(max) of all long and short cones in the ventro-temporal zone was 492 nm, compared to 502 nm in other retinal regions. Anchovies are unique among vertebrates in that they contain clear structural basis for both colour and polarisation vision in the same retina. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Eggs are spawned at the eastern limit of anchovy fishing operations in warm, well-mixed water of low productivity. Recruitment follows a regular pattern with juvenile fish appearing in the catches 250 km north of the spawning ground. A strong shelf-edge frontal jet is a regular summer feature of the area. The ability of the jet current to entrain quantities of anchovy eggs and transport them in the direction of the recruitment ground was shown in October 1976 using a free-drifting parachute drogue. Deterioration of the frontal system and consequently the jet current (with northwest wind) was observed in November 1976. Starvation mortality of early-stage larvae remaining in the spawning ground or carried eastwards by current reversal under northwest wind conditions would be expected to be relatively high compared with larvae transported to the productive upwelling area where recruitment normally occurs.},

abstract = {The scope of this paper is to describe, evaluate, and forecast fishing trip choices of the Bay of Biscay pelagic fleet using random utility modeling (RUM). First, alternative fishing trip choices of this fleet were identified using multivariate statistical methods based on species landings weighted by value and defined as distinct fishing activity or fisheries (termed metiers). A RUM was specified, which included trip components as attributes during the period 20012004 ( a lagged percentage of the value per unit of effort of the main species caught, total value per unit of effort, and inertia in terms of changes from one metier to another). For the main metiers, the proportion of correct effort allocation is 90{\%} during the calibration period of 2001-2004. The results from the RUM are used to parameterize a simulation model of trip choice. The model is used to predict trip choices in 2005, throughout most of which fishing was constrained by the closure of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) fishery. Simulation results are compared with observed trip choices following the fishing ban: 80{\%} of observed trip choices are correctly predicted by the model. The capacity of the behavioral model to predict responses to the closure is then discussed.},

abstract = {This study investigates the connections between climate fluctuations and sardine and anchovy production in the NW Mediterranean, taking the Western Mediterranean Oscillation index (WeMOi) as an indicator of climate variability. The basic working hypothesis is that sardine and anchovy productivity is influenced by the WeMOi, a proxy for the local environmental conditions such as sea surface temperature (SST) and river runoff. Sardine and anchovy landings (1974-2009) in the Catalan Coast and landings per unit of effort (LPUE) were used as proxy for recruitment. The results demonstrated a clear link between climate fluctuations and sardine and anchovy production. Positive WeMOi values were significantly correlated with low SST, high river runoff and high LPUE, that is, with better-than-average recruitment of sardine and anchovy. Conversely, negative WeMOi values were associated with high SST, low river runoff and low LPUE. During the negative WeMOi phases (such as that at the end of the analyzed period), environmental conditions are unfavourable for the overall biological productivity in the NW Mediterranean and would decrease the survival, growth, condition and reproduction of sardine and anchovy during their life cycle. Despite the evidences on the appropriateness of the NAOi as an indicator of the climate in Europe and its impact on some biological variables, we suggest that using a regional index, such as the WeMOi, can provide a more accurate representation of the environmental conditions affecting small pelagic fish production in the NW Mediterranean.},

abstract = {Abundance, biomass, recruitment and fishing mortality of common sardine, Strangomera bentincki, and anchovy, Engraulis ringens, are estimated for stocks distributed in the central-southern area (34-40degreesS) off Chile. Monthly length-frequency data. from July 1990 to November 1999, were used to identify cohorts, to analyze growth, and to determine the monthly age composition of the catches. The abundance of cohorts was estimated using cohort analysis on a monthly time-scale that is sufficiently small for capturing the rapid seasonal changes that characterize both resources. An ADAPT approach was used to estimate the unknown parameters by using catch per unit effort (CPUE) data as auxiliary information. Growth was a regular process for different cohorts of both species, and a seasonal oscillating growth curve was fitted. The parameters of the seasonal von Bertalanffy growth function were: L-infinity = 17.7 cm, K = 0.79 yr(-1), t(0) = -0.347 yr, C = 0.996, and winter point (WP) = 0.373 (r(2) = 0.930, n = 207, P {\textless} 0.05) for common sardine; L-infinity = 20.8 cm, K = 0.444 yr(-1), t(0) = -0.392 yr, C = 0.849, and WP = 0.310 (r(2) = 0.906, n = 203, P {\textless} 0.05) for anchovy. The growth rates were slowest between April and May, before the spawning season. Recruitment of common sardine occurred in November, while recruitment of anchovy tended to occur in January. The yearly pulse of recruitment dominates the population dynamics of both species, and it was observed that the recruitment of the two species varies inversely. The 1997 cohort of common sardine was the lowest in the 1990s, but recruitment of anchovy was higher, probably as a consequence of the 1997-1998 El Nino event. The biomass of the common sardine stock declined from 1997 to 1999, while fishing effort was growing. On the contrary, the biomass of anchovy was higher in 1998 and 1999 due to the stronger cohorts of 1996 and 1997. Evidence for density-dependent catchability was found for sardine, but not for anchovy, At present, both species can be considered as overfished because a growing trend in fishing effort is not compensated by the productivity of the stocks.

Meteor in autumn 1989 larvae of the Southwest Atlantic anchovy, Engraulis anchoita Hubbs and Marini, 1935, were caught in three areas of high hydrographic diversity in the South-west Atlantic. The study had two main objectives: 1) The determination of distinct histological indices of larval nutritional condition, 2) Comparison of the proportion of well and insufficiently fed fish larvae in hydrographically differing environments. The samples were taken (1) in subtropical waters on the Brazilian shelf characterised by upwelling events, (2) in a region off Uruguay which is influenced by the freshwater outflow of the Rio de Ia Plata, and (3) in a tidal mixing front on the Argentine shelf around the Valdez peninsula which is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current. Hauls were carried out in distinct depth layers with modified MOCNESS equipment. About 1000 larvae were prepared using standard histological techniques. As a result of a comparative histological study, cellular appearances of gut and liver were selected to be the criteria for larval condition. In addition, the height of the midgut mucosa was measured to be compared with the histological pictures. A simultaneous classification of organ development stages allowed a stage specific comparison of the histological condition of individual larvae, the gut measurements, and finally the nutritional condition. Evaluating the analytical methods applied, gut mucosa height had to be rejected as a criterion for larval condition, because it did not give significant results within and even between the developmental stages. Histological results showed that only 2 {\%} of the larvae investigated had passed "the point of no return and, therefore, could be classified as starved individuals. The 98 {\%} remaining were composed of well fed larvae or of those having been reversibly emaciated. All of the starved anchovy larvae were caught in Brazilian waters, and especially, the more developed stages showed symptoms of an insufficient food supply Although most of the starved larvae came from an offshore sampling site, the results of the study did not confirm a clear relationship between sampling site or depth and local hydrographical structures or prey densities. Reasons for regional variability in nutritional condition and larval survival are discussed.},

Copepods and other small prey were primary dietary items, the former presumably being concentrated at the level of the deep chlorophyll maximum during daytime. At night only sporadic consumption of large prey items, mostly decapod larvae and mysids, was recorded. The feeding pattern described results in spatio-temporal segregation of feeding and spawning activity and may account for the absence of cannibalism on anchovy eggs. An assessment of the impact of consumption by the anchovy population in the Catalan Sea on zooplankton production underscored the major role played by this species in channelling energy of the pelagic food webs to higher trophic levels.},

abstract = {Otolith increment widths in a temperate reef fish, Parika scaber (Pisces: Monacanthidae), have been shown to vary in different months and to correlate with changes in somatic growth rate. This results in the persistence of a constant otolith-size/fish-size relationship. In the present study, the response of otolith growth to laboratory-induced changes in body growth was determined over a 10-day period in December 1985. Juveniles were subjected to two ranges of temperature (19-21-degrees-C and 24-26-degrees-C) and three feeding levels (fully fed, partially fed, and starved) of a diet consisting of larvae of Opifex fuscus, an endemic mosquito. Fish were individually tagged to ensure that changes in growth rate and any associated changes in otolith microstructure could be accurately determined for any individual. Fully fed fish grew more slowly during treatment than they did prior to treatment, and starved fish did not grow at all. Partially fed fish exhibited a size-hierarchy effect, with larger fish increasing in body size at the expense of smaller individuals. No temperature effect on growth rate was recorded. In contrast to the results from an associated field study, otoliths of fully fed fish continued to increase at the same daily width despite the induced alteration in growth rate. Thus, otoliths were disproportionately large compared with estimates from the field. However, otoliths of starved fish were not as large as predicted from a continual production of daily rings at a constant width. Daily ring deposition may have ceased at different times during the experiment for the starved fish, depending on body size. Alternatively, deposition may have continued, but at a spacing that was not detectable by light microscopy. We conclude that adequate validation of response of otolith growth to changes in somatic growth is necessary before individual growth histories can be back-calculated. This is true even where strong evidence from the field suggests that back-calculation is possible.},

abstract = {For organisms with complex life histories, processes occurring during transitions between stages can strongly affect population dynamics. The major life history transition for many marine species is settlement from pelagic larvae to benthic or demersal juveniles. We examined differential mortality at settlement as a function of early life history traits (size-at-age, growth rates) in three cohorts of two common Caribbean coral reef fishes, Thalassoma bifasciatum and Halichoeres bivittatus (Labridae). We deployed light traps to collect late-stage larvae of each cohort. We also collected juveniles of each cohort at regular intervals (every second day) for two weeks following their first appearance on the nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies, during the spring (April-May) and fall (August-October) of 1997. Comparisons' of otolith-derived traits exhibited by younger recruits (initial group) to those exhibited by older juveniles (survivor group) revealed that there was a difference in otolith growth during metamorphosis for both species: survivors had wider metamorphic bands. In addition, surviving H. bivittatus exhibited higher larval growth rates than settlers, while surviving T. bifasciatum had higher juvenile growth during the first day following emergence onto the reef. Differences in otolith growth rates in the absence of similar changes in somatic size indicate that mortality may have acted upon a growth-based characteristic of condition. We hypothesize that larvae Settling in better physiological condition differentially survived the early juvenile period. Finally, selective mortality appeared to be greatest during a relatively brief window of time surrounding metamorphosis, indicating that this is a critical period. These results point to the demographic importance of transitional periods between stages for animals with complex life cycles. Furthermore, traits exhibited by earlier stages can significantly influence survival during these transitional periods.},

@article{Ospina-Alvarez2012,
abstract = {Small pelagic fish populations exhibit reproductive strategies resulting from past natural selection pressure, by which certain traits become more or less common in a population, allowing them to adapt and become better suited to certain habitats. One such adaptation is the buoyancy of eggs, which is observed as density changes during development. This is an important issue in fisheries and modeling science, as it affects the vertical distribution of eggs and, therefore, egg transport. Recently, individual-based models for anchovies in the Mediterranean have focused on developing adequate biological algorithms to simulate realistic spatial variations of eggs and larvae. Some models that include movements of particles according to Stokes' law also assume a constant value of egg density during egg development. However, field observations show differences in the vertical distribution of eggs when egg density during development is considered. We address the problem of egg density and its vertical distribution within a biological context. In Mediterranean waters, the incubation time for anchovy eggs during peak spawning is approximately 48-70 h; during these first hours, egg density has an influence on the horizontal and vertical trajectories of eggs, as well as their routes and hatching zones. In this study, we introduce an algorithm describing the egg density of European anchovy eggs throughout development. Egg density measurements were carried out in a density gradient column (DGC). We fitted a polynomial model that estimated egg density, as a function of time from fertilization and that was dependent on temperature. Simulations to study the vertical transport of eggs in the Mediterranean were carried out using ICHTHYOP/MARS3D. The vertical distribution of pelagic eggs was determined by a set of interacting biological and physical parameters related to eggs (density, diameter) and ambient seawater (density, viscosity, turbulence), respectively. The egg buoyancy model introduced here was validated and will provide insight for the design of anchovy egg surveys, as the vertical position of the eggs in the water column during development can be inferred by the hydrographic structure of seawater.

In other geographic areas, as well as in laboratory cultures of isolates obtained from various geographic areas, other Pseudonitzschia species have been shown to produce domoic acid. The stomach contents of anchovies caught in Monterey Bay during the following summer were analyzed to identify and determine the abundance of each of the Pseudonitzschia species present. Pseudonitzschia species present in net-tow samples taken at the same time from Monterey Bay were also recorded. In the stomach samples, nine different Pseudonitzschia species were found, including four that have produced domoic acid either under natural or laboratory conditions. These findings illustrate the risk of possible neurotoxin accumulation inherent in the diets of the anchovies studied. The planktophagous diet of the anchovies reflected the plankton composition of the surrounding water and also demonstrates the anchovies' ability to filter pennate diatoms from the near-surface seawater.},

abstract = {Identification and quantification of the main fatty acids in plytoplankton, Zooplanklon and Engraulis encrasicolus larvae were used to study the relationship among the different trophic levels. Three northwestern Mediterranean sea areas were studied as representative of potentially, heterogeneous environments. HPLC pigment analysis was performed to assess the contribution of different phytoplanklon groups to total chlorophyll biomass. In spite of the physical variability,, a homogeneous Pattern in phytoplankton composition among areas was found, with the Prymnesiophyceae representing more than half of the phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass. This homogeneous spatial pattern was also reflected in the phytoplankton fatty acid proportions. Thus, significant amount of 14:0. 18:1 (n-9) and 18:4(n-3) could be related to the dominance of the prymnesiophytes : the low proportion of fatty acid markers of diatoms and dinoflagellates agreed with the low abundances of those phytoplankton groups. Zooplankton fatty acids also showed homogeneous proportions in. the studied areas, with a preferential accumulation of 16:1 (n-7) and 20:5(n-3), and 22:6(n-3). This observation may, indicate a preferential grazing on diatoms and dinoflagellates. Anchovy larvae displayed differing fatty acids contributions related to size. Large larvae contained a hoer proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). Small. larvae showed a high percentage of 18:1(n-9) and 18:4(n-3) fatty acids, considered Prymnesiophyceae biomarkers. These results suggest an additional food resource for die anchovy that is complementary to a zooplankton diet, but probably of protozoan origin, (i.e. microzooplankton). Significant logarithmic relationships were found between dry, mass and 20:5(n-3) anti 22:6(n-3) fatty acid proportions in E. encrasicolus larvae. These PUFA are considered essential for the fish-larvae development.},

abstract = {A survey was carried out on anchovy eggs in the Black Sea, within the framework of the international ComsBlack programme, during the main spawning period in July 1992. Length measurements of anchovy eggs displayed regional differences, as did egg shape. The mean size of eggs found in the northern area was: longitudinal diameter, 1.18 mm (range 1.00-1.37 mm); transverse diameter, 0.74 mm (range 0.62-0.87 mm). The mean size of eggs found in the southern area was: longitudinal diameter, 1.11 mm (range 0.95-1.25 mm); transverse diameter, 0.66 mm (range 0.50-0.80 mm). Eggs in the northern Black Sea were bigger and oval in shape, while both oval and elongated eggs occurred in the southern Black Sea, and of these the elongated eggs were mainly found in coastal regions. The size and shape of the anchovy eggs could not be correlated with salinity and temperature. The occurrence of smaller, elongated eggs in the southern Black Sea, which are characteristic of the Marmara anchovy, might indicate migration of the Marmara anchovy into the Black Sea, which has not previously been recorded.

The anisakids detected were identified as third larval stages of Anisakis larva type I and Hysterothylocium aduncum. Global prevalence was 9.4{\%} for Anisakis and 24.5{\%} for H. aduncum. Analysis of the origin of the anchovies revealed a higher prevalence of Anisakis than H. aduncum in fish from the Atlantic and vice-versa in fish from the Mediterranean. Analysis of various fishing areas in the Western Mediterranean revealed a prevalence of Anisakis in fish from the Ligurian Sea that was 5-fold or more than in the other three areas, with a significantly greater prevalence of H. aduncum in fish from the NW Mediterranean than from the Spanish Mediterranean coast. The prevalence of infection was found to be significantly related to anchovy length for both Anisakis and H. aduncum. More than 55{\%} of Anisakis larvae were found in the muscle. According to these data, the risk of acquiring anisakiasis/anisakidosis from the consumption of raw or under-cooked anchovies may depend upon the area in which they were caught.

abstract = {A drastic population change in Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) has been noted as being related to winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the Kuroshio Extension region. The former studies suggest two possible explanations. One is that temperature itself affects sardine. The other is that SST represents the environmental change of the Kuroshio Extension region and other causes directly affecting sardine. In this study, we found that sardine mortality from post-larva to age 1 negatively correlated with the winter mixed layer depth (MLD) in the Kuroshio Extension region from 1979 to 1993. During the period of a deep winter mixed layer (during the early 1980s), sardine mortality was low, whereas mortality was high when the winter mixed layer was shallow (during the late 1980s to early 1990s). By using a lower trophic-level ecosystem model forced by the observed time series of MLD, SST, light intensity and nutrient data, we found that the estimated spring zooplankton density drastically varies from year to year and has a significant negative correlation with sardine mortality. The inter-annual variation of spring zooplankton density is caused by the winter MLD variation. During the deep winter mixed layer years, a phytoplankton bloom occurs in spring, whereas during the shallow winter mixed layer years, the bloom occurs in winter. The results of our study suggest that the decline in the Japanese sardine population during the late 1980s to early 1990s was due to an insufficient spring food supply in the Kuroshio Extension region where sardine larvae and juvenile are transported.},

abstract = {We studied fine-scale vertical distribution of northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, eggs and larvae and larvae of associated species at two stations off southern California in March-April 1980 using a Manta (neuston) net and a MESSHAI (multiple opening-closing net) sampler. A pump and fluorometry system was used to obtain chloraphyll profiles. A storm with associated heavy seas interrupted sampling for two days at the inshore station and provided an opportunity to compare pre- and poststorm egg and larval distribution and abundance. A total of 95,552 fish larvae were taken in the MESSHAI (63 tows) and Manta nets (41 tows), representing 49 taxa (genera or species) in 27 families. Engraulis mordax was the most abundant fish (95{\%} of the total), followed by Leuroglossus stilbius, Genyonemus lineatus, Stenobrachius leucopsarus, Sebastes spp., Seriphus politus, Peprilus simillimus, Paralichthys californicus, Citharichthys spp., and Merluccius productus. Anchovy eggs and larvae had a shallow distribution: 90{\%} of larvae and 95{\%} of eggs were found in the upper 30 m. Peak egg density was found in the neuston; peak larval density, in the 10-20 m stratum. Larvae of shallow-living shelf species (G. lineatus,P. simillimus, I! californicus) typically occurred in the upper 20-30 m, whereas larvae of predominantly deeper-living demersal species (Sebastes spp., M. productus) were found in the upper 80 m. Midwater species (L. stilbius, S. leucopsarus) occurred at least to 200 m. Anchovy eggs decreased in number after the storm. Anchovy larvae declined even more sharply, despite an increase in zooplankton and potential larval fish prey, suggesting that starvation may have resulted from disturbance of microscale food patches. Alternatively, larvae may have been advected away from the site. Shallow-water shelf species were rare at the inshore station before the storm but appeared suddenly afterwards as a result of seaward advection of shelf water by Ekman transport.},

abstract = {This review presents the results of field studies conducted between 1987 and 1992 on the on reproductive biology and fecundity of the Bay of Biscay anchovy. Close to 100{\%} of the anchovy population reach maturity during the reproductive season, although the smallest 1-year-old anchovy mature slightly later. At peak spawning, however, the reproductive output (numbers of eggs laid daily per unit body weight) of one year oil anchovy is similar to that of older anchovy. Anchovy mainly spawn from 19:00 to 6:00 (GMT) with a peak at 00:00 (GMT). For the females spawning on a given night, the final maturation process of the spawning batch of oocytes starts the night before. The process of nuclear migration proceeds through the night and the first parr of the following day. Oocytes start to hydrate early in the afternoon of the day of spawning. Hydration reaches its maximum intensity at dusk and in the early night. Gonads with postovulatory follicles can already be observed before dusk, indicating the start of spawning activities. Anchovy is a batch spawner with indeterminate fecundity. 'De novo' vitelogenesis proceeds in immature oocytes during the reproductive season. Annual fecundity is determined by both the number of eggs laid per spawning (batch fecundity) and the number of spawnings per season (frequency of spawning and duration of the spawning season). Batch fecundity presents al increasing pattern as the season advances, from ca. 200 eggs/g in April, to ca. 500 and ca. 650 eggs/g in May and June respectively. The fraction of females spawning per day ranges from 18 to 33{\%}, and increases as the season progresses. This high spawning frequency may be related to the relatively short spawning season. Assuming a two month protracted spawning season, the total reproductive output of Bay of Biscay anchovy can range between ca 9,000 to ca. 11,000 eggs per unit gonad-free body weight (g).},

abstract = {Functioning of the Black Sea ecosystem has profoundly changed since the early 1970s under cumulative effects of excessive nutrient enrichment, strong cooling/warming, over-exploitation of pelagic fish stocks, and population outbreak of gelatinous carnivores. Applying a set of criteria to the long-term (1960-2000) ecological time-series data, the present study demonstrates that the Black Sea ecosystem was reorganised during this transition phase in different forms of top-down controlled food web structure through successive regime-shifts of distinct ecological properties. The Secchi disc depth, oxic-anoxic interface zone, dissolved oxygen and hydrogen sulphide concentrations also exhibit abrupt transition between their alternate regimes, and indicate tight coupling between the lower trophic food web structure and the biogeochemical pump in terms of regime-shift events. The first shift, in 1973-1974, marks a switch from large predatory fish to small planktivore fish-controlled system, which persisted until 1989 in the form of increasing small pelagic and phytoplankton biomass and decreasing zooplankton biomass. The increase in phytoplankton biomass is further supported by a bottom-up contribution due to the cumulative response to high anthropogenic nutrient load and the concurrent shift of the physical system to the "cold climate regime" following its similar to 20-year persistence in the "warm climate regime". The end of the 1980s signifies the depletion of small planktivores and the transition to a gelatinous carnivore-controlled system. By the end of the 1990s, small planktivore populations take over control of the system again. Concomitantly, their top-down pressure when combined with diminishing anthropogenic nutrient load and more limited nutrient supply into the surface waters due to stabilizing effects of relatively warm winter conditions switched the "high production" regime of phytoplankton to its background "low production" regime. The Black Sea regime-shifts appear to be sporadic events forced by strong transient decadal perturbations, and therefore differ from the multi-decadal scale cyclical events observed in pelagic ocean ecosystems under low-frequency climatic forcing. The Black Sea observations illustrate that eutrophication and extreme fishery exploitation can indeed induce hysteresis in large marine ecosystems, when they can exert sufficiently strong forcing onto the system. They further illustrate the link between the disruption of the top predators, proliferation of new predator stocks, and regime-shift events. Examples of these features have been reported for some aquatic ecosystems, but are extremely limited for large marine ecosystems. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The effect of salt addition (5{\%} salt) was also studied. Sensory analyses revealed that the storage time was between 4 and 6 days at low temperature and 12 hours at ambient temperature. Certain spoilage characteristics particular to anchovy were defined. Total volatiles bases (TVB) and trimethylamine (TMA) tests were found to be appropriate for assessment of anchovy spoilage and criteria for control were proposed. Histamine production was inhibited by the icing process. Monitoring histamine production is more useful as sanitary index rather than spoilage parameter. At time of rejection, only the moderately halophilic flora reached the limit of 5. 10(5) CFU/g, set by the ICMSF (International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods) and the sulfide producing flora accounted only for 10 to 21{\%} of the total flora. Salting at 5{\%} did not seem to have any effect on the storage time of anchovy at low (in ice) and ambient temperature (20-25 degrees C).},

abstract = {In order to explore mechanistic linkages between low-frequency ocean/climate variability, and fish population responses, we undertook comparative studies of time-series of recruitment-related productivity and the biomass levels of fish stocks representing five life-history strategies in the northern North Pacific between the 1950s and the present. We selected seven species: Japanese sardine (Sardinopus melanostictus) and California sardine (Sardinopus sagax) (opportunistic strategists), walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma, intermediate strategist), pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, salmonic strategist), sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) (periodic strategists) and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, equilibrium strategist). The responses in terms of productivity of sardine, pink salmon, sablefish and halibut to climatic regime shifts were generally immediate, delayed, or no substantial responses depending on the particular regime shift year and fish stock (population). In walleye pollock, there were some periods of high productivity and low productivity, but not coincidental to climatic regime shifts, likely due to indirect climate forcing impacts on both bottom-up and top-down processes. Biomass of zooplankton and all fish stocks examined, except for spiny dogfish whose data were limited, indicated a decadal pattern with the most gradual changes in periodic strategists and most intensive and rapid changes in opportunistic strategists. Responses of sardine productivity to regime shifts were the most intense, probably due to the absence of density-dependent effects and the availability of refuges from predators when sardine biomass was extremely low. Spiny dogfish were least affected by environmental variability. Conversely, spiny dogfish are likely to withstand only modest harvest rates due to their very low intrinsic rate of increase. Thus, each life-history strategy type had a unique response to climatic forcing, owing to their inherent biological traits such as mode, frequency and intensity of reproduction, early life style, age of maturity and longevity. On the other hand, responses of different stocks within a species to climatic regime shifts were unique to each local region, because large-scale climatic forcings are modulated by local physical, chemical and biological processes. The observed response time or absence of response in recruitment-related fish productivity to climatic regime shifts may be influenced by (1) local environmental conditions (immediate, with a delay or no effects), (2) phenological shifts in zooplankton life-history (immediate or with a delay), and (3) stochastic episodic events in both top-down and bottom-up processes (immediate, with a delay or no effects).

Larval and juvenile fish were collected from the mesohaline zone of the Chikugo River inlet during spring 2002. Temperature, salinity, depth, and current velocity were measured. Larval and juvenile abundance were compared among four tidal conditions, flooding tide, high tide, ebbing tide, and low tide, and between day and night. A total of 12 families, 15 species, and 5,577 individuals were collected. Temperature did not vary significantly with tidal conditions whereas salinity, depth, and current velocity varied significantly. Salinity also was correlated significantly and positively with depth. The abundance of most of the fishes was correlated positively and significantly with salinity and depth. Lateolabrax japonicus, Trachidermus fasciatus, Acanthogobius hasta, and other gobiid larvae (Gobiidae spp.) were significantly more abundant during high tide; in contrast, Coilia nasus and Neosalanx reganius were most abundant during low tide. The abundance of most of the fishes was higher during high tides at night than during the day, indicating the existence of STST, which may be strategically associated with ascending progress to upstream nursery areas.},

The results indicated that the mean sensitivity of anchoveta embryos to potassium dichromate was 156.1 mg L(-1) (range: 131-185 mg L(-1)). The statistical data analysis showed high homogeneity in LC50 values among bioassays (variation coefficient = 11.02{\%}). These results demonstrated that the protocol and handling procedures implemented for the anchoveta embryo bioassays comply with international standards for intra-laboratory precision. After secondary treatment, an effluent from a modern Kraft pulp mill was tested for E. ringens embryo toxicity, finding no significant differences from the controls.},

@article{Payne2009,
abstract = {Environmentally induced change appears to be impacting the recruitment of North Sea herring (Clupea harengus). Despite simultaneously having a large adult population, historically low exploitation, and Marine Stewardship Council accreditation (implying sustainability), there have been an unprecedented 6 sequential years of poor juvenile production (recruitment). Analysis suggests that the poor recruitment arises during the larval overwintering phase, with recent survival rates greatly reduced. Contemporary warming of the North Sea has caused significant changes in the plankton community, and a recently identified regime shift around 2000 shows close temporal agreement with the reduced larval survival. It is, therefore, possible that we are observing the first consequences of this planktonic change for higher trophic levels. There is no indication of a recovery in recruitment in the short term. Fishing mortality is currently outside the agreed management plan, and forecasts show a high risk of the stock moving outside safe biological limits soon, potentially precipitating another collapse of the stock. However, bringing the realized fishing mortality back in line with the management plan would likely alleviate the problem. This illustrates again that recruitment is influenced by more than just spawning-stock biomass, and that changes in other factors can be of equal, or even greater, importance. In such dynamically changing environments, recent management success does not necessarily guarantee future sustainability.},

abstract = {The Black Sea is typical of a highly degraded marine ecosystem. Nutrient loads increased dramatically in the 1970s, which appeared to benefit the Black Sea anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). However, the accidental introduction of the comb-jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi, which preys on young anchovy and competes with adults, contributed to a collapse in the anchovy fishery in the late 1980s. Recent efforts to model Black Sea anchovy population dynamics emphasize general environmental influences and do not take these ecosystem shocks explicitly into account. In this paper, I estimate anchovy recruitment using the traditional Ricker model and under rapid nutrient enrichment. Mnemiopsis' influence on anchovy is captured as a shift in the parameters of the recruitment function. By incorporating these environmental disturbances, the seemingly monotonic relationship between parent stock and recruitment for anchovy disappears and is replaced by a dome-shaped stock-recruitment relationship subject to regime shifts.

Oocyte development were categorized in four stages according to cytological appearances.  The size of the oocyte was represented by the length of the major axis.  During the period, March through May, the migrating schools of Japanese anchovy in I-Lan Bay were 11-12 cm in standard length, and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of 4.0-6.0 that indicated the reproductive status of this species in the Bay.  Both GSI and percent of maturation (PM) are valid indices to measure ovarian maturity.

All otoliths showed the ring pattern common to teleost fish, opaque and hyaline rings laid down around an opaque nucleus. To assess the annual nature of otolith rings, the evolution over time of the percentage of opaque rings in the otolith margin was determined. The growth parameters and the growth curves obtained from the interpretation of the growth rings showed a low growth rate for both species. However, C. coelorhynchus grew comparatively faster and attained greater asymptotic size than N. sclerothynchus. Since a considerable variation in size at age was found for both species, the relationship of otolith weight and length to fish length was estimated for each age group. This analysis permits a much greater proportion of fish to be assigned ages than is possible with otolith reading alone. The results suggest that since the otolith growth is not synchronous with the growth of fish, otolith weight can be useful in confirming age distribution of the examined fish species.

abstract = {The spawning habitats of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax in the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem were characterised by comparing their egg abundances with environmental variables measured concomitantly during two different survey programmes: the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Programme (SARP), which comprised monthly surveys conducted during the austral summers of 1993/94 and 1994/95; and annual pelagic spawner biomass surveys conducted in early summer (November/December) from 1984 to 1999. Eggs were collected using a CalVET net. Physical variables measured included sea surface temperature (SST), surface salinity, water depth, mixed-layer depth, and current and wind speeds; biological variables measured included phytoplankton biomass, and zooplankton biomass and production. Spawning habitat was identified by construction of quotient curves derived from egg abundance data and individual environmental variables, and relationships between these variables were determined using multivariate co-inertia analysis. SARP data showed that anchovy spawning was associated with cool water and moderate wind and current speeds, whereas sardine spawning was related to warmer water and more turbulent and unstable conditions (i.e. high wind speeds and strong currents) than for anchovy. SARP data also showed significant differences in selection of spawning habitat of the two species for all environmental variables. The relationship between anchovy egg abundance and salinity was strongly positive, but strongly negative with water depth, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton production. Sardine egg abundance was strongly positively related to current speed. The spawner biomass survey data demonstrated that the spawning habitat of anchovy was characterised by warm water and high salinity, whereas sardine spawning was associated with cool water and low salinity. The survey data showed significant differences in spawning habitat selection by anchovy and sardine for SST, salinity and zooplankton biomass, but not for the other environmental variables. There was a positive relationship between anchovy egg abundance and SST, salinity and mixed-layer depth, and a negative relationship with water depth, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton production. For sardine there was a strong positive relationship between egg abundance and current speed and wind speed. Differences in the results between the two survey programmes could be attributable to differences in their spatio-temporal coverage. Spawning habitats of anchovy and sardine appear to be substantially different, with anchovy being more specific than sardine in their preference of various environmental conditions.},

Plotting discriminant functions 1 and 2, explaining 93{\%} of between-group variability, revealed a high degree of dissimilarity among the anchovy samples, indicating that the anchovies in each sea represent different aggregations. The overall random assignment of individuals into their original group was high (80{\%}). Pairwise comparisons using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed highly significant differences between all the samples (P {\textless} 0.001). Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences with varying degrees between the means of the 4 samples for 16 out of 25 standardized morphometric measurements.

abstract = {Time series analyses (Box-Jenkins models) were used to study the influence of river runoff and wind mixing index on the productivity of the two most abundant species of small pelagic fish exploited in waters surrounding the Ebre (Ebro) River continental shelf (north-western Mediterranean): anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardina pilchardus). River flow and wind were selected because they are known to enhance fertilization and local planktonic production, thus being crucial for the survival of fish larvae. Time series of the two environmental variables and landings of the two species were analysed to extract the trend and seasonality. All series displayed important seasonal and interannual fluctuations. In the long term, landings of anchovy declined while those of sardine increased. At the seasonal scale, landings of anchovy peaked during spring/summer while those of sardine peaked during spring and autumn. Seasonality in landings of anchovy was stronger than in sardine. Concerning the environmental series, monthly average Ebre runoff showed a progressive decline from 1960 until the late 1980s, and the wind mixing index was highest during 1994-96. Within the annual cycle, the minimum river flow occurs from July to October and the wind mixing peaks in winter (December-April, excluding January). The results of the analyses showed a significant correlation between monthly landings of anchovy and freshwater input of the Ebre River during the spawning season of this species (April-August), with a time lag of 12 months. In contrast, monthly landings of sardine were significantly positively correlated with the wind mixing index during the spawning season of this species (November-March), with a lag of 18 months. The results provide evidence of the influence of riverine inputs and wind mixing on the productivity of small pelagic fish in the north-western Mediterranean. The time lags obtained in the relationships stress the importance of river runoff and wind mixing for the early stages of anchovy and sardine, respectively, and their impact on recruitment.},

Focusing on the Peruvian anchovy purse-seine fishery, vessel monitoring system data are used to describe fishing vessels' trajectories, and acoustic survey data to characterize anchovy spatial distribution. Vessel trajectories were analysed in terms of move-length distribution, whereas fish distribution was characterized by spatial extent, concentration, and fractal dimension. Fishers perform Levy flights that can be characterized by a single statistic (mu); mu is significantly correlated with the fractal dimension of fish distribution. It is argued that the Levy statistic is a good candidate for an ecosystem indicator that might contribute to realtime monitoring of ecosystems.

abstract = {The aims of this study were to describe the reproductive cycle of the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) off the south coast of Sicily and determine whether intra- and inter-annual reproductive trait variations, if any, are adaptive responses which maximize reproductive success under environmental fluctuations. Biological data were collected from purse seine and mid-water pelagic trawl commercial catches landed in Sciacca (Sicily) over 6 yr (1997-2002) at fortnightly intervals, analysing a total of 84 581 individuals. No inter-annual changes in length at first reproduction were observed, with a mean pooled value of 11.26 cm for both sexes being found. Spawning intensity, indicated by gonadosomatic index, condition factor and length-weight relationships, seem to be governed by food availability prior to spawning. Anchovy reproductive investment was limited by the area's low primary production. There was a synchrony between reproductive cycle and temperature. Water warming marks the onset of a period of high water stability in the area, and its later cooling marks the onset of a period with low water stability. The relationship between reproductive cycle and temperature is therefore probably a reproductive strategy having evolved to ensure that spawning takes place during the period of the year when water column stability is higher, favouring food concentration and egg and larval retention in the spawning areas.},

Observed egg distributions were compared with monthly composite satellite sea surface temperature (SST) and surface chlorophyll a (chl a) data. Based on the preferred spawning habitat, as defined in SST and chl a space, the satellite data were used to predict potential spawning habitat along two areas of the west coast of North America. Data from the southern area (21.5 to 39 degrees N) were compared to observations from the CUFES data for the period 1998-2005. Northern anchovy and Pacific sardine exhibited distinctly different spawning habitat distributions. A significant relationship was found between satellite-based spawning area and that measured during surveys for sardine. CUFES area estimated for sardine was similar in magnitude to that estimated from satellite data (similar to 60 000 km(2)). In contrast, spawning habitat of anchovy averaged between 1000 and 200 000 km(2) for the period 1998-2005, for CUFES and satellite estimates, respectively. Interannual variability in the area (km(2)) and duration (months) of estimates of suitable habitat varied between species and between the northern (39 to 50.5 degrees N) and southern portions of the California Current. Long-term monitoring of habitat variability using remote sensing data is possible in the southern portion of the California Current, and could be improved upon in the northern area with the addition of surveys better timed to describe relationships between observed and estimated spawning habitats.},

abstract = {The recruitment rate of Peruvian anchoveta, Engraulis ringens, was studied to test the hypothesis that long-term environmental variation (regime shifts) had a significant impact on density-dependent processes governing the anchovy recruitment during the period 1963-2004. On the basis of previous defined regimes and turning points for the Humboldt Current System, we identified two groups of years for increased recruitment of anchoveta (1963-1971 and 1986-2004), and one unfavorable period (1972-1985). A common intercept and significantly different slopes were found when the recruitment rate was plotted as a function of the spawning stock biomass during those groups of years, suggesting that density-dependent effects on recruitment were affected during different climate regimes. The favorable (unfavorable) regime was characterized by higher (lower) zooplankton volumes, and with a higher frequency of colder (warmer) waters. Dome-shaped relationships between recruitment rate, spawning stock biomass and SST, were detected with a Generalized Additive Model for the favorable regime. Thus, recruitment could be explained by non-linear effects of environmental variables. Ultimately, climatic regimes are affecting the density-dependent effects on recruitment of anchoveta and the mechanisms involved may be associated with changes in the carrying capacity of the spawning habitat of anchoveta off Peru, which in turn are related with the effects of cold and warm regimes.

abstract = {The succession of pelagic organisms in the approximate size range 0{\textperiodcentered}5-200 $\mu$m was investigated during a spring diatom bloom in Otsuchi Bay on the Pacific coast of northern Japan. The diatom bloom lasted 3 weeks in the middle of the period examined. The study period was divided into three phases: pre-bloom, bloom and post-bloom. Mesodinium rubrum, an autotrophic ciliate, was abundant in the pre-bloom phase, when vertical mixing was intense. During the bloom phase, the biomass of organisms other than diatoms themselves and bacteria was depressed. A bacterial peak was observed 4 days after the diatom peak and peaks of nano-autotrophs and -heterotrophs occurred after 14 days. Phototrophic picoplankton showed a biomass peak at the same time as nanoplankton. Grazing on diatoms by the copepod population was shown by the occurrences of faecal pellets and copepod nauplii during and after the bloom phase. These results suggest that production of copepods and bacteria depended only on the diatom bloom directly, and that heterotrophic micro-protista depended on the production of pico- and nano-autotrophs in the post-bloom phase.},

abstract = {Correlations among several measures of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and fitness-related variables were assessed in two populations of the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus with fast growth (Aegean Sea) and slow growth (Ionian Sea), respectively. FA levels were borderline significantly higher in the Ionian than in the Aegean for some variables. Variation in otolith shape (deviation from population norm) was lower in the Ionian than the Aegean, contrary to expectation. Within the Aegean, there was no relation between any of the FA indexes and fitness estimators, while in the Ionian a composite otolith FA index was significantly negatively correlated to standard length at age only in 2 year-old individuals. This difference between the Aegean and Ionian may have been related to the lower growth rate in the Ionian, as FA-fitness relations may be more apparent in less-beneficial environments. The absence of significant correlations in the Aegean and the low correlation in one age group in the Ionian suggests that FA is not a sensitive indicator of individual fitness in adult E. encrasicolus.

abstract = {Since the late 1990s, the anchovy Engraulis japonicus stock in the Yellow Sea has undergone considerable decline as a result of the enormous fishing pressure there. Reproductive characteristics have changed during the same period. Fisheries surveys were conducted in anchovy spawning grounds off south Shandong Peninsula in the Yellow Sea from 2000 to 2004, and in Laizhou Bay of the Bohai Sea, the wider Yellow Sea, and in coastal waters of the East China Sea from 2003 to 2008. Anchovy eggs from the spawning grounds south of the Shandong Peninsula (16 to 29 June 2003) had long axes ranging from 1.20 to 1.40 mm (1.28 +/- 0.04 mm), and short axes ranging from 0.60 to 0.68 mm (0.64 +/- 0.02 mm). In the coastal area of the East China Sea (7 to 14 May 2007), the eggs had long axes ranging from 1.12 to 1.40 mm (1.28 +/- 0.06 mm) and short axes ranging from 0.55 to 0.68 mm (0.63 +/- 0.03 mm). Compared with previous research results on anchovy egg size in Chinese waters and in other coastal regions of the North Pacific from the 1950s to 1970s, egg size was notably decreased both at the spawning grounds off the south Shandong Peninsula and in the coastal waters of the East China Sea. The natural mortality rate of anchovy eggs was 80.15{\%} at the spawning grounds off south Shandong Peninsula, 77.63{\%} in the Yellow Sea, and 82.95{\%} in Laizhou Bay of the Bohai Sea. Based on our survey data, the natural mortality rate of anchovy eggs has been as high as 80{\%} in the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea since the late 1990s. Compared with survey results for the Yellow Sea from the 1980s, the natural mortality rates of anchovy eggs have shown a significant rising trend. The decreased size and significantly increased natural mortality rate of anchovy eggs are long-term adaptive responses, via the reproductive biology of the anchovy population, to the enormous fishing pressure in the study area.},

abstract = {The reproductive characteristics of Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus, were studied in Osaka Bay and Wakasa Bay, which are located on each side of Japan. The length of spawning season varied between two bays: 8 months (between April and November) in Osaka Bay and 4 months (between May and August) in Wakasa Bay. The seasonal temperature profiles suggested that not only the onset of spawning in both bays but also the end of spawning in Osaka Bay are highly temperature-dependent, and that the critical temperature is about 15 degreesC. On the other hand, Osaka Bay anchovy collected after July were composed of only small ones (smaller than 10.5 cm body length). A comparison of length-weight relationships revealed a better body condition of small Osaka Bay fish than Wakasa Bay fish. It is likely that the Japanese anchovy in Wakasa Bay ceases spawning as early as September in spite of a high temperature, due to their poor nutritional condition. Estimated spawning frequency ranged from 0.40 to 0.88 for Osaka Bay females and from 0.22 to 0.62 for Wakasa Bay females. These values indicate that the Japanese anchovy from two bays spawn at similar intervals of 1.13-2.50 and 1.61-4.55 days. The sizes at first maturity in Osaka Bay and Wakasa Bay were estimated as 7.38 and 8.53 cm, respectively. These reproductive characteristics are compared and contrasted with those described for the Japanese anchovy in Sagami Bay. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Otolith Sr:Ca ratios of amphidromous ayu fluctuated strongly along the life history transect in accordance with the migration pattern from sea to freshwater, via brackish water in the river mouth. On the contrary, the Sr:Ca ratios of Lake Biwa and hatchery-reared ayu remained at consistently low levels throughout the otolith. The higher ratios in amphidromous ayu, in the otolith region from the center to 220-400 mu m equivalent to the first 90-110 days from hatching, corresponded to the initial sea-going period, suggesting that otolith Sr:Ca ratios are affected by ambient water salinity or the seawater-freshwater gradient in Sr concentration. No relationship between changes in the Sr:Ca ratio and water temperature was found. The findings clearly indicated that otolith Sr:Ca ratios reflected individual life histories, enabling amphidromous ayu to be distinguished from stocked non-amphidromous ayu.},

abstract = {Despite high primary productivity, the yield of pelagic fish in the southern Benguela is relatively low compared to that in the Humboldt system. part of the constraint may be the ability of pelagic fish to reproduce successfully in a strongly pulsed upwelling environment, where enrichment, retention and concentration mechanisms are less compatible than in Peru-Chile. Anchovy Engraulis capensis spawn upstream of the main upwelling centres on the food-poor, thermally stratified western Agulhas Bank, over a protracted summer season (October-February) when high wind speeds of 7-8 m.s(-1) are prevalent. Eggs spawned farther east, on the central or eastern Agulhas Bank, may be subject to increased cannibalism and advective losses, whereas those spawned farther west could be susceptible to heavy advective losses offshore during periods of strong southerly winds. Copepod concentrations are negatively correlated with spawner biomass on the western Bank and are inversely linked to high rates of gonad atresia in anchovy and reduced subsequent recruitment. There is a restricted area of suitable spawning temperatures (16-19 degreesC) on the western Bank, and fish outside that range appear to have less successful spawning, affecting recruitment; a reduction of the duration of spawning appears to decrease the chances of good recruitment. Oil content of pelagic catches on the west coast of South Africa suggests that good feeding conditions for adult fish are also favourable for growth of young fish in the nursery area. An inverse correlation between the numbers of recruits estimated in June and the strength of upwelling-favourable winds over the previous summer indicates the importance of advective loss of eggs and larvae in the transport and nursery areas. The presence of Agulhas Rings close to the shelf-edge, predators on juvenile anchovy, and the strength of upwelling on the West Coast could also be important factors affecting recruitment success. There seem to have been changes in the inshore-offshore distributions of spawning anchovy and/or their eggs over the past three decades, resulting in different recruitment responses to south-easterly winds.},

This study evaluates the presence of alpha(1)-ARs in the liver of two marine teleosts, the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and the mackerel Scomber scombrus, and examines on a broad scale the possibility that habitats posing different challenges also influence phenotypic trait selection. Binding assays were performed also on liver membranes from the carp (1)Cyprinus carpio as a direct comparison with a freshwater species. Scatchard analysis of [H-3]prazosin binding to purified liver membranes from anchovy, mackerel and carp resulted in K-d values of 1.51 +/- 0.085, 1.26 +/- 0.098, and 2.61 +/- 0.22 nM, and B-max values of 87.4 +/- 9.12, 77 +/- 8.29, and 115.22 +/- 3.31 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Thus, alpha(1)-ARs of the two marine teleosts showed higher [H-3]prazosin affinity compared with those of the freshwater/brackish-water fish studied thus far, whereas the number of liver binding sites did not differ significantly from that of carp, eel or trout. A preliminary phylogeny based on amino acid sequence analysis indicated the presence of at least an alpha(1A)-AR in mackerel and an alpha(1D)-AR in both anchovy and mackerel. This is the first indication of alpha(1)-AR subtypes in any marine species, but further studies are needed to ascertain the physiological role of these alpha(1)-ARs in these two marine species.},

abstract = {The spawning season of the Bay of Biscay anchovy population extends from March to August, although most of the reproductive effort is made during May-June. Spawning is triggered by the warming up of surface waters and coincides with the maximum rate of temperature rising and the onset of stratification. Preferential sea surface temperatures are in the range of 14 - 18 degrees C. This population shows a relatively short peak spawning period that seems to be an adaptation to stable and predictable environmental conditions in the SE Bay of Biscay. At the beginning of the spawning season, usually in April, anchovy concentrate in the SE corner of the Bay of Biscay. Later, in May, anchovy spawning is prevalent in the SE Bay of Biscay. As the spawning season progresses, in June. distinct coastal and oceanic spawning areas appear. Simultaneously, the geographic range of spawning extends north and westwards. The Bay of Biscay anchovy selects stable habitats related to river plumes, shelf edge fronts and oceanic eddies, where increased biological production potentially occurs. i) There are low salinity plumes related to main river estuaries (Gironde, Adour and Bidasoa); ii) structures related to shelf break fronts - French shelf to the North of 45 N and southern Bay of Biscay-; and iii) oceanic eddies of slope waters (SWOD-DIES), in oceanic sites outside the continental shelf. The population shows a density-dependent selection of the spawning habitat. The spawning areas associated with the Estuaries of Gironde, Adour and Bidasoa, in the SE region of the Bay of Biscay, seem to form a refuge basin favourable to the maintenance of this population of anchovy even in adverse environmental conditions.},

Screening of the potent volatiles by aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) in the three anchovy samples showed no significant differences between 4 and 8 months of ripening, while the sensory profiles differed in relation to the development of typical ripened aroma notes after 8 months. Results were consistent with a high contribution of highly volatile aldehydes to the desired matured aroma of the final product, as supported by a previous investigation. Ripening at 18 degrees C is recommended for the best control of the process.

FAIR CT97-3253) tries to validate a new methodology applying Flow Injection/Gas Diffusion techniques, to automate the determination of Trimethylamine (TMA-N) and the Total Volatile Basic Nitrogen (TVB-N) for different fish species. The proposed FIGD methods are simple, rapid and can be applied to the on-line monitoring control of fish factories; moreover, they allow the de! termination of both TMA-N and TVB-N using the same equipment. In this work, both FIGD procedures were validated in terms of linearity, precision and recovery for anchovy samples (Engraulis encrasicholus), Reliability results are compared with those obtained using reference methods, AOAC 971.14 for TMA-N and 95/149/CE for TVB-N. In addition, a storage study of fresh E. encrasicholus was done to monitor its TMA-N production along spoilage. Precision was similar for both FIGD and reference techniques, the relative standard deviations being satisfactory, according to Horwitz's formula for intra-laboratory studies. However, less variability occurred with FIGD methods than with reference ones. Accuracy was studied using three standard addition levels for each analyte. Recovery was independent of analyte concentration, showing with FIGD techniques average values of 97.70 +/- 4.03 {\%} for TMA-N and 96.06 +/- 1.48 {\%} for TVB-N. Both FIGD procedures I were reliable and more sensitive than the reference methods. Therefore, they can be useful to evaluate the freshness degree of anchovies, as well as of other;fish species attaining low TMA-N levels. The storage study showed that formation of TMA-N in anchovies,,was slow even at abusive temperatures.},

Light N, derived from river runoff during the rainy season in August, is thought to have been rapidly incorporated into lower levels of the food chain since a sudden drop in delta(15)N was observed in anchovy larvae of two size ranges, 19-21 mm and 29-31 mm SL. Japanese sardine Sardinops melanosticta were found to increase in trophic position more rapidly than Japanese anchovy in the larval life history stage. The isotopic signatures of the larger fish taken from the shirasu (anchovy larvae) fishing nets in August 1994 were suggestive of heavy reliance on anchovy larvae as-a food source. The stable isotope technique was found to be effective in estimating ontogenetic change in trophic position in the Japanese anchovy.},

Almost all published information dealing with parasites as biological tags evaluates differences between localities. However, local variability in the component community has not been assessed. In this work, we examined whether local variation of the metazoan parasite fauna of Engraulis ringens, extracted from five independent samples from two nearby localities in northern Chile, can be a factor causing bias in stock identification. Our results show that local variability, as estimated by a single sample, may suffice to represent component community variability with no need for replicated data.},

abstract = {The hydrography and distributions of cod larvae on Georges Bank were surveyed during two research cruises in April and May 1993 in order to relate larval drift between cruises to the vernal intensification of the frontal component of the residual circulation. We observed the transport of two patches of cod larvae. One patch, which had maximum larval cod densities of 45 larvae 100 m(-3) in April, appeared to have been advected south about 75 lan between surveys, while the other, which had maximum larval cod densities of 20 larvae 100 m(-3) in April, appeared to have been advected north-northeast about 25 km. Maximum larval densities in each patch sampled during the second cruise in May were 15 and 18 larvae 100 m(-3), respectively, and mean growth in total length for larvae in the two patches was approximately 5.5 mm and 4.5 mm, respectively, between the two cruises. During the April cruise there was a large volume of anomalous cold, fresh water, of Scotian Shelf origin, which occupied much of the eastern third of Georges Bank. During May, relatively cold, fresh water appeared in a band from the Northeast Peak along the Southern Flank, between Georges Bank water on the top of the Bank, and upper Slope Water offshore. The distribution of cold, fresh water suggests its participation in the general clockwise circulation around the Bank. The transport of co larvae comprising the first patch appeared to become organized within, and move along, the frontal boundary established by the Scotian Shelf-like watermass, while larvae in the second patch, which we assumed to have moved to the north, may have been transported northward in an on-Bank how of warmer and saltier upper Slope Water, which may have originated from a Gulf Stream Ring. Based upon observed transport of the first patch of larvae in relation to the frontal boundary, we present a conceptual model of frontal mixing currents on Georges Bank, where current velocities may reach 5 cm s(-1) at the depth of the pycnocline. We suggest that this frontal component of the residual circulation, which is in addition to that resulting from tidal rectification, may be important in the transport of fish larvae, and that interannual variability in the degree of intrusion of extrinsic water masses may contribute to variable larval cod drift patterns, to variable larval cod retention on the Bank, and ultimately, to variable larval fish recruitment to the early juvenile stage.

abstract = {The North Sea autumn-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) stock consists of a set of different spawning components. The dynamics of the entire stock have been well characterized, but although time-series of larval abundance indices are available for the individual components, study of the dynamics at the component level has historically been hampered by missing observations and high sampling noise. A simple state-space statistical model is developed that is robust to these problems, gives a good fit to the data, and proves capable of both handling and predicting missing observations well. Furthermore, the sum of the fitted abundance indices across all components proves an excellent proxy for the biomass of the total stock, even though the model utilizes information at the individual-component level. The Orkney-Shetland component appears to have recovered faster from historic depletion events than the other components, whereas the Downs component has been the slowest. These differences give rise to changes in stock composition, which are shown to vary widely within a relatively short time. The modelling framework provides a valuable tool for studying and monitoring the dynamics of the individual components of the North Sea herring stock.},

abstract = {Tarletonbeania crenularis specimens were collected off Oregon in 2006 and 2009 and aged by enumeration of growth increments in otoliths (sagittae). Three microstructural zones were evident in the otoliths of juvenile and adult fish: central, middle, and external. The number of increments in the central zone are thought to be deposited during the larval phase which is restricted to the uppermost 350 m water layer. The middle zone constituted of barely visible increments, most likely represented a non-migratory behavior of transforming larvae and early juvenile stages. Well defined growth increments were found in the external zone which was presumably formed during extensive vertical migrations of juvenile and adult fish. If the enumerated increments were deposited daily, as previously validated for other myctophid species, the examined individuals indicated a shorter life span than has been formerly reported on the basis of length frequency analysis. The otolith microstructure interpretation was supported by otolith size to fish length proportions and somatic growth of larvae and postlarval fish. Otolith length to standard length relation was described by linear regression models for larvae and postlarval migratory stages with an abrupt disruption between these two groups. The number of growth increments in otoliths plotted against standard length showed a curvilinear growth for larvae and for the postlarval fish. The lack of information on the size at age of transforming larvae and non-migratory early juveniles did not allow us to estimate a complete growth model for T crenularis. However, a pronounced decrease in growth between larval and postlarval migratory phases was distinguished. The uncoupling of otolith and somatic growth was interpreted as a merged effect of downward migration of larvae to the mesopelagic transformation depth, prolonged stay of transforming larvae and early juveniles at this depth without performing diel vertical migrations, and shrinkage during metamorphosis. Back-calculated hatch dates suggests a prolonged spawning season of this species without any distinct peak.},

abstract = {Several individual-based models (IBMs) have recently been developed to improve understanding of factors impacting on recruitment variability of anchovy (Engraulis capensis/encrasicolus) in the southern Benguela. These IBMs have focused on early life history stages ( eggs through to post-larvae) as it is thought that variations in anchovy recruitment strength are primarily driven by biological and/or physical factors impacting on these stages. The pelagic zone of the Benguela system constitutes an ideal system for studying the coupling between biological and physical processes; in the IBMs this coupling is obtained by releasing particles endowed with biological properties in the virtual currents resulting from the output of a hydrodynamic model of the southwestern coast of South Africa. The particles are tracked through virtual time and space and their final locations are assessed in terms of previously defined criteria deemed to promote successful recruitment. The aim of this paper is to provide a synthesis of the results of IBMs of the early stages of anchovy in the southern Benguela constructed to date. Emphasis is placed on the methodological aspects of these studies and on the sequential link of several simulation experiments of increasing complexity. In addition to improving understanding, such an approach allows for effective interplay between modelling experiments and surveys or laboratory experiments. Details of individual IBM experiments and their results have been published elsewhere.},

abstract = {Pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum (O. keta), and sockeye salmon (O. nerka) represent approximately 90{\%} of the commercial catch of Pacific salmon taken each year by Canada, Japan, the United States, and Russia. Annual all-nation catches of the three species and of each species, from 1925 to 1989, exhibited long-term parallel trends. National catches, in most cases, exhibited similar but weaker trends. The strong similarity of the pattern of the all-nation pink, chum, and sockeye salmon catches suggests that common events over a vast area affect the production of salmon in the North Pacific Ocean. The climate over the northern North Pacific Ocean is dominated in the winter and spring by the Aleutian Low pressure system. The long-term pattern of the Aleutian Low pressure system corresponded to the trends in salmon catch, to copepod production, and to other climate indices, indicating that climate and the marine environment may play an important role in salmon production.},

abstract = {To obtain information about how water temperature affects the embryonic development of Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica) eggs, the developmental rates and hatching times of three lots of eggs were quantified at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28 and 31 degrees C. Hatching time was shortened at higher temperatures with eggs at 28 degrees C hatching within 23-28 h after fertilization, while eggs at 19 degrees C took 48-54 h for their hatching. At 22 and 25 degrees C, eggs hatched out within 35-43 h and 27-32 h, respectively. There was no successful hatching at 16 or 31 degrees C. The developmental stages until hatching were divided into morula, blastula, gastrula, eye vesicle and ear vesicle formation and heart formation. Development of the embryos were also faster at higher temperature especially after the gastrula stage, but the morphological features of each stage were the same at all water temperatures. The final developmental stage before the eggs died at 16 and 31 degrees C differed among the lots. Eggs maintained at 25 degrees C showed a high hatching rate (mean: 69{\%}), compared to other water temperatures (mean: 12{\%} at 19 degrees C, 32{\%} at 22 degrees C, 4{\%} at 28 degrees C). The results from present study indicate that the optimal temperature for egg incubation is around 25 degrees C. similar to the likely temperatures experienced by eggs and early larvae in the spawning area.

abstract = {This study develops a new back-calculation method, based on the larvae of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), that takes into account the variation of growth rate over time. Known-aged larvae were reared in four 60-L microcosms during 49 days in order to obtain a large range of individual growth trajectories. We first validated the daily nature of the otolith increment deposition rate. The proposed time-varying growth (TVG) method weights the contribution of each increment in the length calculation using a growth effect factor. A small growth increment contributes less to the length increase of larvae than its relative importance in total otolith growth. On the other hand, a large growth increment contributes more to the length increase of larvae in comparison with its relative importance in total otolith growth. This method provided significantly better estimates of previous length-at-age than the biological intercept (BI) method at the individual level. In addition, the TVG method tended to provide more accurate estimates of previous length-at-age than the BI method at the population level, but the difference was not significant. The importance of using the TVG method instead of the BI method to back-calculate individual and population growth trajectories increases with the magnitude of the growth effect and the variation in growth rates over time.},

abstract = {Winter-to-spring variability in sea surface temperature (SST) and mixed layer depth (MLD) around the Kuroshio current system and its relationship to the survival rate (ln [recruit per spawning stock biomass], LNRPS) of Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus) were investigated based on a correlation analysis of data from 1980 to 1995. The data were from a high-resolution ocean general circulation model using the ‘Kuroshio axis coordinates', in which the meridional positions are relocated to a latitude relative to the Kuroshio axis at each longitude, rather than the geographically fixed coordinates. A significant positive (negative) correlation between LNRPS and winter MLD (winter–spring SST) was detected near the Kuroshio axis from areas south of Japan (where eggs are spawned) to the Kuroshio Extension (where larvae are transported). This result is in contrast to previous studies using geographically fixed coordinates, which showed a significant correlation predominantly in the area south of the Kuroshio Extension in winter, where at this time few larvae have been found. From the late 1980s to early 1990s, when the survival rate was remarkably low, MLD around the axis was shallow and SST was high. Although MLD and SST show a significant correlation, significant partial correlations were also observed between February MLD and LNRPS when the contribution of SST was excluded, and between March SST and LNRPS when the contribution of MLD was excluded. We presume that MLD shoaling reduced the nutrient supply from deep layers, resulting in less productivity in the spring, and SST warming could have a negative influence on larval growth.},

abstract = {Developmental models for skin exist in terrestrial and amphibious vertebrates but there is a lack of information in aquatic vertebrates. We have analysed skin epidermal development of a bony fish (teleost), the most successful group of extant vertebrates. A specific epidermal type I keratin cDNA (hhKer1), which may be a bony-fish-specific adaptation associated with the divergence of skin development (scale formation) compared with other vertebrates, has been cloned and characterized. The expression of hhKer1 and collagen 1 alpha 1 in skin taken together with the presence or absence of keratin bundle-like structures have made it possible to distinguish between larval and adult epidermal cells during skin development. The use of a flatfish with a well-defined larval to juvenile transition as a model of skin development has revealed that epidermal larval basal cells differentiate directly to epidermal adult basal cells at the climax of metamorphosis. Moreover, hhKer1 expression is downregulated at the climax of metamorphosis and is inversely correlated with increasing thyroxin levels. We suggest that, whereas early mechanisms of skin development between aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates are conserved, later mechanisms diverge.},

abstract = {Tetracycline labelling of otoliths was used for studying the growth of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), which has strong individual variability. Two groups of eels were injected with tetracycline and released into a natural pond (Camargue, south of France) in spring 1989 and in autumn 1989. The marginal growth of otoliths between marking (tetracycline mark) and capture (otolith margin) was measured for all fish sampled until spring 1990. Comparisons of otolith growth rates were made according to fish size, age, sex, and growth period (ANCOVA). The results showed a great variability. After 15 mo of growth, the mean growth in length (back-calculated) was 6.6 cm. The three main factors tested, age, sex, and seasonal growth period, had a significant effect on otolith growth and therefore on somatic growth, since the relation between fish length and that of the otolith is highly significant (r2 = 0.802). There was also a very significant effect of size at marking on otolith growth. It is difficult to rank qualitative importance of these various factors, even though there are no interactions among them. The best absolute growth in Mediterranean lagoons could be attained by 2-yr-old female fish growing in the summer months.},

Larval and juvenile fishes were sampled using the trawl at stations in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region from 29 May to 24 June 1998. A total of 44 oblique tows were conducted and towing depths of the frame trawl had a high degree of stability despite the various sea conditions and the fluctuations in the ship speed.

abstract = {The objective of this work was to describe inter- and intra-annual variations in the environmental characteristics of the North-eastern Aegean Sea and to relate these changes to the egg and larval distributions, growth and feeding of larval anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). Four cruises, two in July and two in September in 2003 and 2004 were performed. The distributions of eggs and larvae were associated with i) salinity fronts related to the Black Sea Water and ii) shallow areas of high productivity over the continental shelf, some of them with high riverine influence. The first published description of the anchovy larval diet in the Eastern Mediterranean was conducted in individuals ranging from 2.2 to 17 mm standard length. The number of non-empty guts was relatively high (between 20{\%} and 30{\%}), and the diet was described through 15 main items. The mean size of the prey increased with larval size, and was generally dominated by prey widths smaller than 80 gm (mainly the nauplii and copepodite stages of copepods). Small larvae positively selected copepod nauplii. As larvae grew, they shifted to larger copepod stages. At all sizes, larvae rejected abundant taxa like cladocerans. The average trophic level calculated for anchovy of all size ranges was 2.98 +/- 0.16 (SE). Growth rates varied from 0.41 to 0.75 mm d(-1), with the highest growth rates generally observed in September. Variability in the Black Sea Water influence and the recorded inter- and intra-annual changes in primary and secondary production, combined with marked changes in temperature over the first 20 m depth, are used to frame the discussion regarding the observed significant differences in growth rates in terms of both length and weight.

abstract = {The ontogeny of swimming speed, schooling behaviour and jellyfish avoidance was studied in hatchery-reared Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus to compare its life-history strategy with two other common pelagic fishes, jack mackerel Trachurus japonicus and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus. Cruise swimming speed of E. japonicus increased allometrically from 1.4 to 3.9 standard length (L(S)) per s (L(S) s(-1)) from early larval to metamorphosing stage. Burst swimming speed also increased from 6.1 to 28 L(S) s(-1) in these stages. Cruise speed was inferior to that of S. japonicus, as was burst speed to that of T. japonicus. Engraulis japonicus larvae were highly vulnerable to predation by moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita and were readily eaten until they reached 23 mm L(S), but not at 26 mm L(S). Schooling behaviour (indicated by parallel swimming) started at c. 17 mm L(S). Average distance to the nearest neighbour was shorter than values reported in other pelagic fishes. The relatively low predator avoidance capability of E. japonicus may be compensated for by their transparent and thus less conspicuous body, in addition to their early maturation and high fecundity.

Seasonal delta(18)O(A) variations of individual otoliths started at an initial value of about -0.5 to 0parts per thousand VPDB, and then reached a stable level in the range of +2.5 to +3.5parts per thousand VPDB after 4-5 years. The initial low values correspond to the natal sources of mature cod, while the higher delta(18)O(A) values represent the water conditions before the cod was caught. This pattern of delta(18)O(A) variation was observed, over the life history of all cod examined. Furthermore, the calculated isotopic temperatures agreed with those obtained from summer bottom trawl survey, indicating that delta(18)O(A) of otoliths could be used as a thermometer in determining the ambient seawater temperature where the cod lived. Comparison of long-term delta(18)O(A) records and biological and meteorological observations suggested that decadal-scale ecosystem changes did occur in the late 1970s and early 1990s in Atlantic Canada, comparable to regime shifts occurred in the North Pacific.},

abstract = {Greater nutrient loads since the 1950s have increased the extent and duration of hypoxic conditions in the Patuxent River and the Chesapeake Bay (Maryland, USA). We linked watershed, water quality, and individual-based predation models to predict how changes in local (Patuxent River watershed) and regional (bay-wide) nutrient loading rates would affect bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli egg and larval mortality rates in the lower region of the Patuxent River. Nutrient loadings affected hypoxic volume and the degree of spatial overlap between anchovy and their predators. Mortality rates were simulated during June and July under combinations of a wet or dry year, reduced and increased nutrient loadings from the Patuxent River watershed, and increased and decreased nutrient loadings into the Patuxent River at the Chesapeake Bay boundary. Chesapeake Bay water quality at the downstream boundary had a much larger effect on egg and larval mortality rates than nutrient loading rates from the Patuxent River watershed, and these responses were consistent with the downstream boundary condition having a greater effect on hypoxia. Water column structure, year type (wet/dry), and location within the lower Patuxent River had smaller effects on egg and larval mortality. Due to indirect effects, the effect of the Chesapeake Bay boundary condition on larval mortality rates during June was opposite to that predicted for egg mortality rates. Our results illustrate that statements and justifications about the benefits of nutrient loading reductions on estuarine ecosystems should avoid oversimplification, be specific, and recognize that species responses to changes in environmental conditions can be complex and variable.},

abstract = {Transport and survival of larvae of pelagic fishes in the Kuroshio system region were studied using Lagrangian drifter data recorded from 1990 to 2003. A large portion of the drifters from the Kuroshio area south of Japan spread around the Kuroshio Extension up to 170 degrees E, while some moved south to the offshore area of the Kuroshio because of a recirculation gyre. The monthly mean eastward movement from areas south of Japan was approximately 800-900 km, which was smaller than previous numerical estimates. The results of a survival model assuming optimal temperatures for larvae suggest that surface waters during the observation period were too warm for larval Japanese sardine, which has an optimal temperature of 16 degrees C, and the adult abundances did not increase during the observation period. In contrast, the spawning ground temperatures and transport conditions from an area south-west of Japan in April-June matched the requirement for the larval Japanese anchovy, which has an optimal temperature of 22 degrees C. The combined effects of temperature variations due to seasonality and water mass mixing are suggested to play an important role in determining the environmental temperatures that occur in an area.},

abstract = {Historical changes in the distributions of temperate species in response to Milankovitch climate cycles have been well documented in palaeontological studies and recently evaluated with phylogeographical methods. How these cycles influence biological diversity remains a matter of debate. Molecular surveys of terrestrial and freshwater fauna demonstrate glacial refugia in low latitudes and range expansions into high latitudes, but few genetic studies have assessed the corresponding impact on marine fauna. In the present study, mtDNA sequences (N = 84) are surveyed to understand the impact of long-term climate oscillations on 'Old World' anchovies (genus Engraulis), a monophyletic group occurring in north and south temperate zones of the eastern Atlantic and the western Pacific. The analysis of a 521-bp sequence of mtDNA cytochrome b indicates a late Miocene or Pliocene dispersal from the north-eastern Pacific (California-Mexico) to the north-western Pacific (Japan), followed by Pleistocene dispersal from the north-western Pacific to Europe. Geography mandates that populations in southern Africa and Australia were stepping-stones for this dispersal. However, neither population occupies an intermediate position in the mtDNA genealogy; both populations are more recently derived from their northern neighbours. Haplotype diversity is high (h = 0.93-0.97) in European, Australian, and Japanese anchovies, but low (h = 0.22) in the southern African population, where all haplotypes are more closely related to European specimens than to each other. These southern populations occupy a precarious position, lacking north-south coastlines that allow range shifts during climatic extremes. Recurring extinctions and episodic recolonizations from northern hemisphere populations are the likely results. In this case, ocean-climatic changes retard rather than enhance opportunities for evolutionary radiations.

abstract = {New recruits of the bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum were censused and collected from nearshore reefs of Barbados, West Indies, every 2 weeks for 20 months. Their temporal coincidence with low salinity ({\textless}34(.)5) water during their pelagic larval stage was determined by comparing the otolith records of new recruits with conductivity and temperature records from a current meter moored 2km off the west coast of the island. Larval residence in a low salinity North Brazil Current (NBC) ring appeared to have a negative impact on growth. Larvae that encountered a NBC ring for at least 7 days during either the first half of the larval period exhibited slower larval growth than those that did not encounter a ring for 7 days during any part of their larval period. As a result of this slower growth, larvae that encountered low salinity waters had a longer pelagic larval duration and were larger at the time of settlement. The magnitude of settlement was not distinctly related to the presence or absence of a NBC ring, but the largest settlement event occurred at the end of the longest ring event. Early juvenile growth did not vary between fish that had encountered a ring and those that did not, so size differences at settlement were propagated through the first week of life on the reef. The potentially opposing attributes of fast and slow-growing larvae (e.g. fast growing larvae with shorter larval stage duration but smaller size at settlement and higher susceptibility to reef predation), and the resulting differential mortality on the reef may promote the persistence of individuals in the population with contrasting life history traits, and contribute to the lack of a relationship between larval growth and recruitment success. Positive transport related effects of rings (i.e. enhanced retention during some ring events) may further complicate matters by outweighing the negative impact of rings on larval growth.

abstract = {Anchovy recruitment determines fish production and thus the sustainable exploitation of anchovy in the Yellow Sea. Haizhou Bay is a traditional spawning and nursery ground for anchovy. The retention of anchovy in its early life stages appears to be related to observed fronts. Cruises have confirmed that anchovy eggs are distributed in high density patches, particularly in the tidal frontal zone. Front and egg patches shift to the shallow area in the warm season. A diagnostic Hamburg Shelf Ocean Model was applied in the East China Sea and Yellow Sea to simulate the frontal circulation and particle movement, forced by monthly wind speed and measured temperatures. It was observed that the jet along the front and upwelling in the mixed side of the front play an important role in the transport of eggs. Convergence and divergence areas are frequently induced by frontal shear instability and topography potential vorticity balance. Numerical experiments show that tidal mixing and front play an important role to converge particles like eggs. When eggs are caught in the convergence zone they are aggregated into a patch. The convergence zone has good feeding condition for eggs to hatch and larvae to grow.},

abstract = {Large-scale climatic conditions prevailing over the central Baltic Sea resulted in declining salinity and oxygen concentrations in spawning areas of the eastern Baltic cod stock. These changes in hydrography reduced the reproductive success and, combined with high fishing pressure, caused a decline of the stock to the lowest level on record in the early 1990s. The present Study aims at disentangling the interactions between reproductive effort and hydrographic forcing leading to variable recruitment. Based on identified key processes, stock dynamics is explained Using updated environmental and life stage-specific abundance and production time-series. Declining salinities and oxygen concentrations caused high egg mortalities and indirectly increased egg predation by clupeid fish. Low recruitment, despite enhanced hydrographic conditions for egg survival in the mid-1990s, was due to food limitation for larvae, caused by the decline in the abundance of the copepod Pseudocalanus sp. The case of the eastern Baltic cod stock exemplifies the multitude effects climatic variability may have oil a fish stock and underscores the importance of knowledge of these processes for understanding stock dynamics.

The availability of extensive information on bioenergetics of the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) allows us to use this species as a case study. We modeled two types of potential behavior that fish could use to exploit a patchy environment: (i) maximizing growth rate or (ii) maximizing survivorship to adulthood and reproduction, which is a function of both growth and avoiding predation. Patterns from existing data sets on gut contents and growth rates from the field for juvenile E. mordax were consistent only with the prediction of maximizing survivorship. The model makes further testable predictions about (i) expected swimming velocities between zooplankton patches, (ii) patterns of size segregation in the formation of schools, (iii) the proportion of zooplankton patches that schools consume, and (iv) reactions to decreases in environmental quality. Overall, the model predicts that anchovies spend at least 25{\%} of their time in schools that are too large to be energetically economical and suggests further research on several variables that could affect populations of schooling fishes.},

The paper describes the methodology for reading the larval and juvenile otoliths, for reconstructing the correspondence in space and time between juveniles and larvae using Lagrangian simulations, and for comparing the otolith growth rates among the reconstructed sub-cohorts. Virtual buoys were released weekly on the grid of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and their trajectories were tracked. The origin of an individual was determined by selecting the trajectory beginning on its hatching week and ending at the minimum distance of its sampling location on the sampling date. Larvae and juveniles with the same spatio-temporal origin were selected and supposed to belong to the same sub-cohorts. The surviving juveniles showed faster growth rates during their larval period than the pool of larvae they were estimated to originate from, which supports the idea of growth-selective survival. Alternative interpretations ( transport and gear selectivity) are discussed. Variations in otolith growth pattern also suggest a higher juvenile growth over the shelf break than in oceanic waters.},

Plankton samples, as well as temperature and salinity measurements were obtained during eight cruises in 1992 and 1993. Larval growth was estimated based on daily marks on sagitta otoliths, using the Laird-Gompertz model since it yielded the best hatching size (HS) estimates. Mean daily growth (MDG) and HS showed a cyclical variation pattern. In both years the highest values were recorded in spring (1992, MDG = 0.19 mm d(-1) and HS = 1.47 mm; 1993, MDG = 0.23 mm d(-1) and HS = 1.58 mm) and the lowest in winter (1992, MDG = 0.14 mm d(-1) and HS = 1.08 mm; 1993, MDG = 0.15 mm d(-1) and HS = 1.21 mm). The variation pattern of these parameters was directly and closely related to that of temperature. The mortality rate ranged from 0.05 to 0.26, also with a cyclical pattern, but contrary to that of growth and temperature. Cyclical patterns are not well documented for tropical and subtropical areas, such as the southern Gulf of Mexico, where fish spawn throughout the year and spring may be considered the beginning of the cycle, with spring cohorts showing the highest growth rates and those of winter the lowest. The greater change in temperature that occurs from winter to spring may be the factor triggering these events.},

abstract = {The oceanographic conditions in the north Pacific have shifted to a colder period, Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass has declined precipitously in the California Current, the international sardine fishery is collapsing, and mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus and Scomber japonicus) are thriving. This situation occurred in the mid-1900s, but indices of current oceanographic conditions and the results of our acoustic-trawl surveys indicate it likely is recurring now, perhaps with similar socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Also alarming is the repetition of the fishery's response to a declining sardine stock-progressively higher exploitation rates targeting the oldest, largest, and most fecund fish. Furthermore, our data indicate the recent reproductive condition of sardine is poor, and their productivity is below modeled estimates used to derive the current fishery-exploitation rates. Consequently, the sardine population has been reduced to two cohorts that are unlikely to produce an appreciable new cohort. Thus, a near-term recovery of this important stock is unlikely, depending on the return of warmer oceanographic conditions, reduced pressure from mackerel species, and perhaps the adoption of a more precautionary strategy for managing the residual sardine population.},

The larvae and early juveniles were not only collected in the same geographical area they were also of the same size (range 15-43 mm standard length, L(S)), similar ages and were collected during the same seasons (May to July). Although the two clupeid species experienced very similar environmental conditions, there were significant discrepancies in the analysed relationships. The otolith growth of larval and juvenile smelt was very strongly related to somatic growth while temperature had a minor effect. In herring, the effect of somatic growth, although clearly visible and statistically highly significant, was of less importance than temperature. Furthermore, variation in the otolith size and L(S) relationship was affected by temperature and somatic growth in both species, but the variance of otolith size at L(S) was higher for herring than for smelt. Although growth backcalculation from otoliths can presently be recommended as an appropriate method for use with both smelt and herring (despite possibly lower precision and accuracy with the latter), other methods referring directly to short-term increment width changes (e.g. marginal increment analysis) are recommended for smelt but not for herring.

abstract = {Background. If a link exists between somatic and otolith growth, otolith size and microstructure analysis can be a useful tool in studies of larval fish growth and condition-methods like growth back-calculation or marginal increment width analysis can be employed. Because significance of that link may vary among species and can be additionally modified by temperature, the aim of the present paper is to evaluate how sagittal otoliths of Atlantic menhaden responded to somatic growth and temperature. Materials and methods. Larval Atlantic menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus (Latrobe, 1802) (age range: 20-120 days; length range: 14-35 mm SL), collected during 3 years were evaluated for length-at-age and groups of the shortest and longest-at-age individuals (8{\%} of sampled population in each group) were used in the analyses. Similarly, otolith size-at-age estimated from sagittae length was evaluated and then compared with the earlier estimated growth indices of larvae. Results. Otolith growth rate (OGR) indicated growth differences among analysed larvae. Additionally, temperature effect on OGR independent of somatic growth was detected for larvae that were short-at-age (i.e., the slow growth group). For the fast grow group, temperature effect on OGR was insignificant. Conclusion. Back-calculation of growth from otoliths of larval and early juvenile Atlantic menhaden is justified but less accurate estimates can be expected for the slowest growing individuals due to the independent temperature effect on otolith growth.},

abstract = {Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus larvae, collected from 2 different sites in the Western Mediterranean Sea (the Gulf of Lions and the Catalan Sea), were analyzed for daily growth rates and RNA and DNA content. An exponential function describes the growth pattern. The larvae were shown to have a growth rate of 0.56 mm d(-1) at 8 mm (standard length). Anchovy larvae from the Gulf of Lions showed higher daily growth rates than larvae from the Catalan Sea. In accordance, sagittal size, measured in terms of otolith area and radius, of larvae from the Catalan Sea were smaller than those of larvae from the Gulf of Lions. RNA/DNA ratio ranged from 1.09 to 7.79, and the mean RNA/DNA ratio was 4.49. Anchovy larvae from the Gulf of Lions were shown to have a higher slope in the RNA (mu g larva(-1)) versus DNA (mu g larva(-1)) relationship than larvae from the Catalan Sea. This indicates that the former were in better condition. However, due to the high variability of the RNA/DNA ratio, no significant differences in RNA/DNA ratio were found between the 2 areas. A preliminary study of the relationship between environmental factors and the RNA/DNA ratio was performed for each region. The RNA/DNA ratio of larvae from the Catalan Sea correlated negatively with temperature and positively with relative fluorescence and organic matter, while in the Gulf of Lions there was a positive correlation with temperature and no relation with relative fluorescence or organic matter.},

abstract = {We describe a simple biostatistical model of reproductive success (logarithm of recruits/spawner) applied to three coastal pelagic fish stocks off southern California: northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax, and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus. We used the model to detect possible influences of gross climatic conditions and contaminant loadings (particularly of metals and organochlorines) on reproduction in these three stocks. Data included several decades of annual estimates of recruitment and stock size, monthly measures of climate, and annual estimates of contaminant loadings; the model included a compensatory stock-size component before adding environmental effects. The study was meant to generate, rather than test, hypotheses. For the chub mackerel stock, we detected climate influences, but no contaminant influences, on reproductive success, which was usually high during conditions typical of El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. For the northern anchovy stock, we detected no climate or contaminant influences on spawning success; however, the negative results may reflect low statistical power, rather than absence of contaminant influences. For spawning success in the Pacific sardine stock, we detected no consistent climate influences, but we found a strong negative correlation with contaminant loadings. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that contaminant loadings accelerated the collapse of the Pacific sardine stock while it was under stress from severe overfishing. Although many scientific questions about validation of models, mechanisms of action, and identity of specific deleterious contaminants remain to be answered, the observed data are well described by the hypothesis of contaminant-mediated decline.},

For the first time, otolith delta O-18 was measured using a continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry system. The linear relationship between otolith delta O-18 and temperature was determined as follows: delta(otolith) - delta(water) = -2.70 (T degrees C) + 5.193 (r(2) = 0.806, p {\textless} 0.01). The temperature-dependent fractionation of otolith delta O-18 was close to that reported for inorganic aragonite, indicating that the vital effects of isotopes are small. The otolith delta O-18 values of juveniles reared at a mean of 26.5 degrees C were not significantly different from those of larvae reared at 26 degrees C. With regard to the 2 pairs of otoliths within an individual fish, the differences in delta O-18 values between the left and right otoliths were subtle. The otolith delta O-18 values of larvae reared in delta O-18-depleted seawater (24 to 26 degrees C at 32 psu; delta O-18, -0.17 parts per thousand) were lower, but were not significantly different from those of larvae reared in + 0.31 parts per thousand water, which is the delta O-18 value of the water in which the spawners were raised. These results suggest that the sample size for the 32 psu experiment was too small and that the rearing durations were too short to affect the otoliths completely. Our results demonstrate that otolith delta O-18 values of Pacific bluefin tuna larvae can provide precise and accurate estimates of their ambient temperature experience.},

abstract = {The gonad of Spratelloides gracilis was not sexually differentiated in the yolk-sac, preflexion, flexion and postflexion stages. Sexual differentiation and development of the ovary and testis started in the transition stage from larva to juvenile. In juveniles at the fin ray completion stage, the ovary and testis could be distinguished because the ovary contained germ cells initiating meiosis and the testis had blood vessels and a high density of somatic cells. The ovary further developed in larger juveniles to have oocytes of perinucleolus stage together with those of the chromatin nucleolus stage, and oogonium. However, in the testis of larger juveniles, primary spermatogonium began proliferation by meiosis. Sexual differentiation may be regarded as one of morphological and functional changes accompanying metamorphosis in S. gracilis. Some fish larger than the mature size of 60 mm standard length had advanced germ cells and functional gonads, others did not have functional gonads. The distal end of the immature gonads did not connect with a genital duct near the anus. These observations indicate that S. gracilis has large variability in size-at-maturity. The variability in size-at-maturity in S. gracilis, together with large variability in age-at-maturity, may constitute an ecological basis for an extended spawning season in S. gracilis.},

Survival response surfaces are used to illustrate the relative effects of episodic and subtle mortality during early life. It is the subtle variability associated with small changes in growth or mortality rates that may exert the greater effect on recruitment. Massive advective losses of eggs or larvae, failed egg production, and acute contaminant mortalities are examples of episodic events that may impact recruitment significantly but which need not be catastrophic. Stabilization of recruitments through density-dependent growth rate variability in early life is demonstrated to be potentially important. Whether this mechanism actually is important in the sea remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Anchovy and round sardinella are two important small pelagic species in the Mediterranean that spawn during the summer period. This is a first attempt to model and predict the two species' potential spawning habitats in this area. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were constructed based on satellite environmental variables and presence/absence egg data, available from ichthyoplankton surveys conducted in the North Aegean Sea during early summer (June 2003-2006). These models were subsequently used to predict the probability of anchovy and round sardinella spawning in the Greek Seas as well as the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea during the same month of the year. The interaction of bottom depth and chlorophyll explained most of the deviance in the presence/absence GAMs of both species, indicating spawning over continental shelf areas with increased surface chlorophyll values. Round sardinella spawned closer to coast than anchovy. Predicted potential spawning areas for anchovy and round sardinella in unsampled areas of the Greek Seas and the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea were in good agreement with existing information on the distribution and extent of the spawning grounds, especially for anchovy. Modeling the species' reproductive activity in relation to easily accessible environmental information and applying the models in a predictive way could be an initial, low-cost step to designate potential spawning fish habitats.},

abstract = {Presence in the same individual of two highly diverged types of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) implies either that the two types accumulated mutational differences while coexisting in the Same female lineage or that two independently diverged lineages anastomosed through biparental transmission. Cleavage-site mtDNA analysis in anchovies revealed 3 heteroplasmic individuals among 435 examined. All three contained the same two types of molecules that differed at 7 cleavage sites in a total of 26 surveyed by seven restriction endonucleases. Estimates of the time of heteroplasmy persistence in other species are much shorter than the time needed for this level of divergence. No heteroplasmic individuals were found for mtDNA molecules differing by fewer cleavage sites. This also argues against the hypothesis of gradual divergence in a single lineage, as it would imply selective removal of much more frequently occurring lower-level heteroplasmies. The two types of molecules found in heteroplasmy were the most common in the population, as expected from the hypothesis of paternal leakage. We conclude that the heteroplasmy that we have observed resulted from biparental mtDNA inheritance in anchovies.},

A total of 24 and 47 nucleoticle sites were detected variable defining 29 and 32 haplotypes in cyt b and COI data, respectively. All variable sites except one in COI were silent in the two sets of sequences. The Ewens-Watterson test indicated that the observed allelic configurations in both data sets were in full agreement with neutral expectations. The variation level was high, with h = 0.957 {\&}PLUSMN; 0.018, $\pi$ = 0.644 {\&}PLUSMN; 0.387 ({\%}) in cyt b data set and h = 0.958 {\&}PLUSMN; 0.021, $\pi$ = 0.640 {\&}PLUSMN; 0.386 ({\%}) in COI data set, respectively. However, at the population level, Fst values between pairs of populations were not significantly different from zero (P {\&}GT; 0.05) in both data sets. The analysis of haplotype frequency distribution showed no significant differences among populations. Similarly, the analysis of the partitioning of molecular variance indicated that all or almost all of the genetic variation was distributed within populations. Based on the data from this study, the existence of separate genetic stocks in this area were not detected. Mixing of stocks to some extent in migration cycle and dispersal capacity of anchovy's planktonic larvae could be the reasons for genetic homogeneity in this species in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.},

abstract = {The anchoveta, Engraulis ringens, has shown fluctuations of their abundance and distribution at interdecadal scale along the South Pacific. However, the recent spatial and temporal variability of the reproductive events are unknown in their southernmost geographic distribution. Therefore, the spatial and temporal variability in the spawning of E. ringens in the fjord region of southern Chile between 1995 and 2005 was analysed. The ichthyoplankton samples collected in the inland sea of southern Chile between 42 degrees S and 47 degrees S during 1995-2005 with Bongo nets showed an increase in the mean abundance of anchoveta eggs, varying from mean values of 38 eggs per 10 m(2) during October 1995 to {\textgreater} 14,000 eggs per 10 m(2) during November 2005. Moreover, comparing our data with previously published information on anchoveta egg size along Chile (Llanos-Rivera {\&} Castro 2004), the eggs collected during November 2005 in the inland sea were larger, wider and with higher volume than eggs collected from northern and central Chile. In the inland sea during November 2005, the anchoveta spawning was located mainly inside deep fjords (Comau and Reloncavi fjords); in such deep fjords abundance of both, eggs and preflexion larvae (i. e., {\textless} 9 mm) were higher ({\textgreater} 5,000 eggs per 10 m(2); up to 2,178 larvae per 10 m(2), respectively) than at shallow waters of Chiloe Island ({\textless} 100 eggs per 10 m(2); up to 65 larvae per 10 m(2)). Additionally, postflexion larvae (i. e., {\textgreater} 9 mm larval length) were collected exclusively in the fjord region (10-505 larvae per 10 m(2)). The Brunt-Vaisala frequency (N(2)) showed positively significant correlations with anchoveta eggs and larvae abundance, meaning that higher abundance of both eggs and larvae were collected in areas with more stable water columns. This stability may induce higher survival rates of early life stages of anchoveta and may be related with the recent increasing in the landings of other small pelagic fishes such as the Falkland sprat (Sprattus fuegensis).},

abstract = {Several growth hypotheses have been tested to investigate why males of the sequential hermaphrodite, Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, Coris julis (Linnaeus, 1758), are relatively larger than females of the same age. Individual growth trajectories were estimated to test these hypotheses. A good linear relationship between otolith size and body size was observed (r (2) = 0.71, n = 609), thus, past somatic growth of any specific fish can be inferred from the longitudinal data described by the width of annual increments in the otolith. These data were successfully analyzed by a non-linear mixed-effect model (von Bertalanffy growth model) using a Bayesian approach. The results obtained suggest that Mediterranean rainbow wrasse secondary males are relatively larger than females because 1) fish that change sex are already the larger individuals in their age group (specifically those with higher growth rate, k (secondary males) = 0.199 and k (females) = 0.161) and 2) they experience a growth spurt after sex change. The differences in growth observed in this species and in other protogynous hermaphrodites could be related to differences in social organization, which, in turn, are related to differences in the sex change mechanisms.},

abstract = {In recent years, the decline of the fish resource in the Yellow Sea has been dramatic. The fish community structure is changing. We determined the stable isotope and fatty acids composition in the Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) (dominant species) food web in the Yellow Sea, China, to study the ecological variation especially in the shifting trophic level. The major fatty acids found in the species were 14:0, 16:0, 16:1n-7, 18:0, 18:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 20:5n-3, and 22:6n-3, which made up 60-80{\%} of the total fatty acids (FA). Scomberomorus niphonius and Conger myriaster were richer in 18:1n-9. A higher percentage of saturated FA and lower percentage of polyunsaturated FA were found in Pseudosciaena polyactis, Chelidonichthys kumu, and Priacanthus macracanthus. A special feature of the grassfish was the high level of 20:4n-6. An enrichment of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes was observed from phytoplankton and zooplankton to fishes: the stable nitrogen isotope varied in the range 2.9-13.9 parts per thousand and the mean values of stable carbon isotopes of fishes tended to vary within a limited range (-19.4 to -17.9 parts per thousand). Both delta(15)N and specific fatty acids (such as 18:1n-9, DHA, EPA) showed a good relationship with trophic level. A distinct change in the fatty acids signature and stable isotopes was observed for the Japanese anchovy with the increase in body length, which was independent of the variety of geographic locations. Egg and postlarva samples were richer in 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, and C22:6n-3. The major fatty acids were 16:0 and 18:1n-9, followed by 20:5n-3, 22:6n-3, and 20:4n-6, in young and adult Japanese anchovy. The shift in diet between the different life stages could be the explanation for this observation. Variations in trophic levels can be proven using stable isotope and fatty acids compositions, but this should be done with caution, such as with the application of principal components analysis in this study.

In the two experiments conducted in summer, the number of otolith microincrements between alizarin complexone (ALC) marks showed that microincrements were formed daily. In the summer 2005 experiment, immature anchovy under conditions of reduced daily food rations also showed daily microincrement formation. Average increment width was 0.9 mu m in adults and 1.8-3.1 mu m in immature anchovy. In contrast, no clear increments were observed between ALC marks on the otoliths from the experiment in winter 2006, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations failed to confirm clear increment formation. We consider that low water temperatures ({\textless}13-14 degrees C) restricted otolith growth and lowered the contrast between the discontinuous and the incremental zones of the otolith increments. For age estimation of Japanese anchovy, clear increments wider than about 1 mu m in the otolith can be regarded as daily increments. However, daily age estimation of immature and adult anchovy that experience low water temperatures in winter may be difficult due to the obscurity of the increments.},

abstract = {The match-mismatch hypothesis (MMH) predicts that marine fish larvae will have their highest rate of growth and survival when they overlap with their prey. However, Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and other gadids continue to thrive in the Bering Sea despite delayed prey production resulting from warming and loss of sea ice. In this study, we examined how temperature mediates growth and survival of Pacific cod larvae under varying match-mismatch conditions. Cod larvae were reared at two temperatures (3 degrees C and 8 degrees C) and exposed to one of five different food treatments over a 6-week period: (i) high food (HF) (match); (ii) low food (LF); (iii) HF then LF (HF-LF); and (iv) LF then HF (LF-HF) (24 mismatch); and (v) no food (NF) (complete mismatch). Results showed that cold environments allow Pacific cod larvae to bridge gaps in prey availability (i.e., timing and magnitude), but negatively impact survival over longer periods. Under warmer conditions, mismatches in prey significantly impacted growth and survival. However, both yolk reserves and compensatory growth mechanisms reduced the severity of mismatches occurring in the first 3 weeks of development. Our results demonstrate a clear need to incorporate the direct effects of temperature on fish larvae in food limitation models.},

Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) of different body lengths from the Huanghai Sea (Yellow Sea) were determined to better understand their variability and reasons during its life history. The mean content was 45.12{\%}, 10.12{\%} and 2.02{\%} for C, N and P, respectively. Significant differences in C, N and P elemental composition were found among different sizes, which could be explained by varying proportions of storage compounds in whole body fish, and varying degrees of ossification. Considering abundant resources in Japanese anchovy, it was an important P-pool in the cycle of P. Moreover, the excreted N/P ratio was significantly different in fishes of different sizes, especially at high gross growth efficiency. In the past two decades, overexploitation tended to cause smaller body length in the community structure of anchovy, which presumably changed the nutrient cycle in food webs of the Huanghai Sea. Exptrapolation of the results indicates that Japanese anchovy may be important for conveying nutrient in the Huanghai Sea.},

abstract = {The influence of feeding history on otolith shape and symmetry was examined in juveniles of 2 species of coral reef fish, Amphiprion akindynos and Pomacentrus amboinensis. Fast Fourier analysis was used to describe the shape of otoliths of fish from a variety of experimental feeding treatments, ranging from starvation, through pulse feeding, to feeding ad libitum. The resulting harmonics from both the left and right otoliths of each individual fish were used in a multivariate analysis to investigate shape differences among feeding treatments in the 2 species. When left and right otoliths were analysed separately, no significant differences between feeding treatments were revealed for either species. In contrast, when left and right otoliths from individuals were analysed together, clear separations in feeding groups were observed in both species. Differences among feeding treatments were largely due to differences in the finer details of the otolith shape, represented by the middle level harmonics. Fish that had been starved had significantly different otolith shapes than fish from all other treatments. Differences in otolith shape could not simply be attributed to differences in fish size or age among treatments. We conclude that differences in otolith shape are influenced by recent feeding history, but processes that influence otolith shape are complex and most likely species-specific. This study presents new evidence that otolith shape of tropical fish may directly reflect body condition of individuals regardless of fish size and age.},

abstract = {Decadal fluctuations in salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll, a variety of zooplankton taxa, and fish stocks in the Northeast Pacific are often poorly correlated with the most widely-used index of large-scale climate variability in the region - the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We define a new pattern of climate change, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and show that its variability is significantly correlated with previously unexplained fluctuations of salinity, nutrients and chlorophyll. Fluctuations in the NPGO are driven by regional and basin-scale variations in wind-driven upwelling and horizontal advection – the fundamental processes controlling salinity and nutrient concentrations. Nutrient fluctuations drive concomitant changes in phytoplankton concentrations, and may force similar variability in higher trophic levels. The NPGO thus provides a strong indicator of fluctuations in the mechanisms driving planktonic ecosystem dynamics. The NPGO pattern extends beyond the North Pacific and is part of a global-scale mode of climate variability that is evident in global sea level trends and sea surface temperature. Therefore the amplification of the NPGO variance found in observations and in global warming simulations implies that the NPGO may play an increasingly important role in forcing global-scale decadal changes in marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Application of an individual-based particle tracking model to the migration of tropical fish larvae along the continental shelf between the Houtman Abrolhos Islands and Rottnest Island (Western Australia) has shown that there is potential for the southwards advection of passive particles/larvae in the Leeuwin Current system throughout the year. However, seasonal variations in the prevailing wind field result in corresponding seasonal changes in the surface current flow (both alongshore and cross-shelf) on the continental shelf, leading to a pulse of modelled particles arriving at Rottnest Island during the autumn months. This matches, within a month, the observed April/May peak in annual recruitment of 2 species of damselfish (Abudefduf sexfasciatus and A. vaigiensis), at the time when the Leeuwin Current is strengthening. It is assumed that the larvae are in the uppermost 20 m of the water column and that there are no vertical diurnal movements. The model has a 10 km grid spacing, and so can resolve some of the current gradients across the continental shelf. Comparison of the modelled near-surface currents with ADCP measurements at 2 current mooring sites as well as with a broader range of historical current measurements off southwestern Australia indicates that the alongshore net transport is reasonably well reproduced by the model, whereas agreement with the cross-shelf flow is not as good (this may be partly attributed to the paucity of high-quality near-surface current measurements in the area of study). Because of limitations in our knowledge of the swimming ability, choice of swimming direction and habitat selection of larval fish, as well as the inability of the model to reproduce the small-scale circulation around Rottnest Island, the swimming capacity of the late-stage larval fish is not specifically included; they are considered as potential settlers once they have reached within 20 km of the Island. The observed inter-annual variability in recruitment is not as well matched by the model as is the seasonal pattern, but this is almost certainly due to uncertainties in biological factors such as spawning strength, food and predation en route, which are not known. The modelled results are also applied to a more general discussion of the transport of eggs and larvae of commercial fish and invertebrate species on the Western Australian continental shelf, and it is shown that the seasonality and position on the shelf of the spawning may play a large role in the movement (and hence survival and ultimate recruitment) of different species.

The abundance and distribution of eggs and preflexion larvae of both species and, in order to detect potential variations in abundance was analyzed. Our results showed that eggs of both species tended to aggregate at the coast. The spatial extensions of preflexion larvae were broader than that of eggs of both species, along a coast- to- ocean direction. The distribution of the early life stages of both species over the continental shelf off the Itata River mouth was variable inter-annually. These egg and larval abundances showed significant variations among years and the eggs abundance was higher than of larvae. The highest egg and larval abundances occurred at salinities between 32 psu and 34 psu. However, occasionally it was possible to find aggregations in lower salinities (20-24 psu) in the nearby zone of the Itata river mouth. The area contiguous to the river mouth, however, showed low abundance of egg and larvae during the period studied.},

abstract = {Aromatic amino acids (AA, phenylalanine and tyrosine) are the precursors of thyroid hormones, which regulate metamorphosis in all vertebrates. In fish, this is a critical developmental stage where physiological requirements for aromatic AA may increase. Therefore, it is possible that dietary aromatic AA supplementation may be beneficial to accomplish a successful transition from larvae to the juvenile stage. This work aimed to assess the effect of dietary aromatic AA supplementation on tyrosine metabolism in species with an accentuated (Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis) and a less marked (gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata) metamorphosis. For this purpose, either species were fed Artemia and subsequently received or not an aromatic AA supplement through tube-feeding, together with a L-[U-(14)C] tyrosine marker, throughout metamorphosis. Tyrosine was elected as a tracer since the metabolic fate of this aromatic AA is directly linked to the production of thyroid hormones and metamorphosis. Results showed that dietary phenylalanine supplementation did not increase tyrosine retention in Senegalese sole larvae during metamorphosis, suggesting that this species may not be able to biosynthesise tyrosine from phenylalanine at a sufficient rate to supply its physiological requirements until after metamorphosis. Furthermore, dietary tyrosine supplementation effectively increased tyrosine availability in Senegalese sole body fluids at metamorphosis, most likely for coping with metamorphosis-related processes, such as production of thyroid hormones. Therefore, dietary tyrosine supplementation may be beneficial for Senegalese sole during metamorphosis. On the other hand, results indicated that gilthead seabream larvae do not seem to require an additional supply of aromatic AA during metamorphosis, probably because the physiological requirements for tyrosine do not increase during this developmental stage. The different results observed for Senegalese sole and gilthead seabream are probably related to the complexity of metamorphosis that each species undergoes and to the needs for production of thyroid hormones, which seems to affect aromatic AA requirements during this critical stage of development. These findings may be important for physiologists, fish nutritionists and for the flatfish aquaculture industry. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To obtain more insight into reproductive mechanisms in clupeiform fishes, molecular cloning of the Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus luteinizing hormone beta (LH beta) and glycoprotein hormone alpha (GPH alpha) subunits, and immunocytochemistry of gonadotrophs in the pituitary using antisera raised against the synthetic peptides for both subunits were carried out. The cDNAs for LH beta and GPH alpha subunits consisted of 963 and 535 nucleotides encoding 141 and 122 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of the E. japonicus LH beta subunit showed a 60{\%} similarity to the Pacific herring Clupea pallasii LH beta subunit and 24-31{\%} similarities to FSH beta subunits of other fish species. The E. japonicus GPH alpha subunit showed 52-57{\%} similarities to anguilliform and cypriniform GPH alpha subunits. Both the subunits have typical structural characteristics of each subunit such as N-linked glycosylation sites, conserved cysteine residues and highly conserved short amino acid sequences. These results indicate that cDNAs cloned in this study encode the E. japonicus LH beta and GPH alpha subunits. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that both the LH beta and GPH alpha subunit genes were abundantly expressed in the pituitary, and the GPH alpha subunit was observed to be weakly expressed in the extrapituitary tissues. Immunocytochemistry of the E. japonicus pituitary showed that cells that immunoreacted with antiserum against the LH beta subunit were distributed in the peripheral regions of proximal pars distalis, and these cells were also immunoreactive to antiserum against the GPH alpha subunit. An abundant number of both LH beta and GPH alpha cells in the pituitary of matured fish were observed, in comparison with immature fish. These results indicate that the E. japonicus LH is involved in the final reproductive maturation as well as those of other teleosts.},

The experiments were conducted in 30 l tanks with three levels of turbidity obtained by dissolving 0, 50 or 300 mg l(-1) of kaolin. Predators were introduced to experimental tanks followed by larvae of E. japonicus ranging from 5 to 25 mm standard lengths (L(s)). When exposed to T. japonicus, the mean survival rate of larvae was significantly higher in 300 mg l(-1) treatments compared to the other turbidity levels. When exposed to A. aurita, however, there was no difference in the survival rates among different turbidity treatments. The survival rates when exposed to either predator improved with larval growth. The logistic survivorship models for E. japonicus larvae when exposed to A. aurita had an inflection point at c. 12 mm L(s), suggesting that their size refuge from A. aurita is close to this value. Comparison to a previous study suggests a high vulnerability of shirasu (long and transparent) fish larvae to jellyfish predation under turbidity. This study indicates that anthropogenic increases of turbidity in coastal waters may increase the relative effect of jellyfish predation on fish larvae.},

abstract = {Analysis of stable oxygen isotopes in otoliths is a promising technique for estimating the ambient temperature experienced by fish, but consistent equations relating temperature and fractionation of stable oxygen isotopes in otoliths among different fish species are lacking. Juvenile cod were reared at constant temperatures from 6 to 20degreesC and the sagittal otoliths were analysed for oxygen isotope values. We determined that temperature-dependent fractionation of oxygen isotopes in the otoliths was close to that reported for inorganic aragonite at low temperatures, but there were deviations from oxygen isotope fractionation equations for otoliths of other species. The linear relationship between oxygen isotope value in the cod otoliths and temperature was determined to be: 1000 Ln alpha = 16.75 (10(3) TK-1) - 27.09. Temperature estimates with 1 degreesC precision at the 95{\%} probability level require a sample size of greater than or equal to5 otoliths. Only an insignificant amount of the variance in the data was due to variance between left and right otolith, and due to repeated measurements of otolith subsamples. This study confirms that stable isotope values of cod otoliths can give precise and accurate estimates of the ambient temperature experienced by fish.

abstract = {New estimates of sardine (Sardinops sagax) biomass suggest that a change in state of the Peruvian upwelling ecosystem, previously thought to be from one of anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) dominance to one of equal abundances of sardine and anchoveta, has been a clear switch in dominance from anchoveta to sardine. The sardine stock inhabits the northern part of the Peru upwelling system and extends its distribution into waters off Ecuador. Virtual population analyses show the population to have been considerably larger than was previously thought, with a biomass in 1982 estimated at between 1 5 and 1 8 million tonnes. The anchoveta collapse appears to have allowed a large bloom in sardine abundance. Sardine stock size has declined in recent years, concurrently with estimated mortalities in excess of F0.1 and declining recruitment.},

abstract = {We have modeled the prey-predator dynamics between nutrients, phytoplankton, and copepods in Hiuchi-nada, central part of the Seto Inland Sea. The model parameters were estimated by stepwise regression using data sampled from 2001 to 2005. We re-created the fluctuations in copepod biomass in the spring-summer of 2001-2004 by model simulation and investigated the relationship between the re-created copepod biomass and anchovy Engraulis japonicus reproductive success rate in Hiuchi-nada. The anchovy reproductive success rate was proportional to the copepod biomass during the last 10 days of May, a period that immediately preceded anchovy recruitment. This relationship indicates that a possible key factor in the regulation of anchovy population levels is the fluctuation in abundance of the copepod assemblage and that the crucial period for anchovy recruitment in Hiuchi-nada would be the period just before anchovy recruitment to the shirasu (body length: approx. 20-35 mm) fishery. These results provide a potential framework for forecasting the anchovy recruitment level that is based on both larval abundance and survival rate as estimated from the biomass of copepods in the pre-recruitment period of anchovy.},

abstract = {Fishery collapses frequently result from combined pressures of the environment and man, which are difficult to discern because of the complexities involved and our limited knowledge. Models to resolve this complexity often become too sophisticated, with too many assumptions and, consequently, with little capacity to predict beyond calibration data. In this paper we implement a different procedure where the model is kept simple and uncertainty accounts for the equation imperfectness to reproduce ecological complexity. Human and environmental forcing on an anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) stock are simulated with only six parameters plus their error terms, and the uncertainty is computed with Bayesian methods. The simple structure is able to reproduce the major dynamical features of this species in the Gulf of Cadiz, including data on life stages and age structure that had no contact with the model. This is a distinct performance for a frugal approach working on a mid-trophic species and a positive instance where parsimony can simulate the interaction of man, fish and the environment, provided uncertainty is accounted for in the process.},

abstract = {Previous surveys of population structure in the Atlantic-Mediterranean anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus L. have reported heterogeneity in morphology, allozyme frequencies, and mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies at a regional scale. In particular, two stocks of anchovy have been detected in the Adriatic Sea. In this paper, the available data is reviewed with the aim to relate genetic variation to geography at the widest possible geographical scale, for investigating the evolutionary mechanisms underlying stock structure in anchovy. Correspondence analysis of allozyme frequencies (24 samples, three polymorphic loci) compiled from the literature indicates three distinct entities in the Mediterranean Sea. Open-sea or oceanic anchovy populations are genetically different from inshore-water populations within a region (Nei's (G) over cap (ST) = 0.035-0.067), while broadscale geographical variation is weak for each of these two habitat-specific forms (G) over cap (ST) = 0.005-0.006). Mitochondrial-DNA haplotype frequencies support the distinction between an inshore form and an oceanic form ((G) over cap (ST) = 0,067-0.107), with virtually no genetic differences among oceanic populations across the Gulf of Biscay, the western Mediterranean and the Ionian Sea ((G) over cap (ST) = -0.001). If natural selection on marker loci is unimportant, these results indicate the occurrence of two parapatric, genetically distinct, habitat-specific forms that are widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Persistent allele and haplotype-frequency differences between these forms indicate reproductive isolation and the presence of an E. encrasicolus species complex in the Mediterranean.

abstract = {In recent years a northward expansion of Sardinella aurita has been reported in the western Mediterranean. Considering the coexistence of its larvae with those of the dominant species Engraulis encrasicolus, the present study was conducted to compare their vertical distributions in 2 areas off the Catalan coast with different vertical environmental conditions. During summer, the water column was stratified with a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) beneath the pycnocline. However, the southern area, under the influence of the Ebro River, was characterized by a secondary surface chlorophyll maximum. Vertical distribution of larval food, nauplii and copepodites showed good agreement with the high chlorophyll layers. In the earliest stages of development, larvae of both species remained in the upper levels. From 6 mm standard length on they developed a day/night migratory behaviour to search for food during the day (feeding period). Therefore, in the south, where the abundance of potential food in the upper layers was relatively high, larvae of both species remained in the upper levels during the day. However, in the north, where food was restricted to the DCM, only E. encrasicolus larvae were able to reach these deep levels. The low temperatures (similar to 15 degrees C) detected at the DCM may restrict the vertical migration of S. aurita in accordance with their thermophilic character. This limitation might represent a restriction for the northward expansion of this species in the western Mediterranean.},

Growth and mortality rates were more variable in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transitional waters than in the Kuroshio waters. The estimated production of 40-mm preschooling juveniles was a positive function of larval production in the hatching length class (5.9-9.9 mm) in the Kuroshio waters. In the Kuroshio-Oyashio transitional waters, rather than larval production in the hatching length class, cumulative survival through the larval and early juvenile stages determined the juvenile production. Variable growth and survival rates of saury observed in the transitional waters seem to be associated with large environmental variability in the waters, including shifts of the Kuroshio and Oyashio fronts and development of streamers and eddies between the fronts.},

abstract = {Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) stock abundance is tightly driven by the high and unpredictable variability of the Humboldt Current Ecosystem. Management of the fishery therefore cannot rely on mid- or long-term management policy alone but needs to be adaptive at relatively short time scales. Regular acoustic surveys are performed on the stock at intervals of 2 to 4 times a year, but there is a need for more time continuous monitoring indicators to ensure that management can respond at suitable time scales. Existing literature suggests that spatially explicit data on the location of fishing activities could be used as a proxy for target stock distribution. Spatially explicit commercial fishing data could therefore guide adaptive management decisions at shorter time scales than is possible through scientific stock surveys. In this study we therefore aim to (1) estimate the position of fishing operations for the entire fleet of Peruvian anchovy purse-seiners using the Peruvian satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS), and (2) quantify the extent to which the distribution of purse-seine sets describes anchovy distribution. To estimate fishing set positions from vessel tracks derived from VMS data we developed a methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) trained on a sample of fishing trips with known fishing set positions (exact fishing positions are known for approximately 1.5{\%} of the fleet from an at-sea observer program). The ANN correctly identified 83{\%} of the real fishing sets and largely outperformed cornparative linear models. This network is then used to forecast fishing operations for those trips where no observers were onboard. To quantify the extent to which fishing set distribution was correlated to stock distribution we compared three metrics describing features of the distributions (the mean distance to the coast, the total area of distribution, and a clustering index) for concomitant acoustic survey observations and fishing set positions identified from VMS. For two of these metrics (mean distance to the coast and clustering index), fishing and survey data were significantly correlated. We conclude that the location of purse-seine fishing sets yields significant and valuable information on the distribution of the Peruvian anchovy stock and ultimately on its vulnerability to the fishery. For example, a high concentration of sets in the near coastal zone could potentially be used as a warning signal of high levels of stock vulnerability and trigger appropriate management measures aimed at reducing fishing effort.

abstract = {Otoliths have frequently been used to reconstruct growth histories in larval, juvenile and adult fish. However, there is growing evidence that otolith growth is directly determined by metabolic intensity and, consequently, only indirectly related to somatic growth. By performing measurements of oxygen consumption rate and other early life-history traits on individual eggs of zebrafish (Danio rerio), we found that oxygen consumption explained residual variance in otolith size that is not accounted for by egg size. Total oxygen consumption during the embryonic stage explained 34{\%} of the variance in sagitta size at hatch, whereas larval size at hatch (as a proxy for growth during the embryonic period) was not significantly correlated with sagitta size. This strongly suggests that otolith growth is directly related to metabolic rate, and yields a mechanism that may explain recent observations of a link between otolith size at hatch and viability in larval fish.},

abstract = {We assessed the fatty acid (FA) composition of anchoveta eggs collected from the plankton along with female anchoveta reproductive traits and environmental conditions during peak winter spawning in 2005 and 2007. Environmental conditions differed markedly between years at 3 continental shelf stations off Talcahuano, Chile, with a warmer, fresher water column in 2005 and a colder, saltier one in 2007. We confirmed differences in sea surface temperature, measured both at the coastal egg collection stations and using satellite images over a broader area, caused by south winds that induced coastal upwelling in 2007. Winter 2005 was largely dominated by typical small omnivorous and carnivorous copepods (Oncaea and Oithona), whereas in 2007, larger herbivorous calanoid copepods (with high polyunsaturated FA [PUFA] levels that are typical of upwelling conditions) and diatom abundance (indicated by the docosahexaenoic/eicosapentaenoic acids [DHA/EPA] ratio) increased. Although anchoveta eggs were smaller in 2005, batch size and relative fecundity per female were greater in 2007 because of larger ovaries. While relative amounts of saturated (SAFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) FA, and PUFA in anchoveta eggs in 2005 were within the ranges reported for marine fish species, in 2007, PUFA were in the upper and SAFA and MUFA in the lower ranges. Our results suggest that the higher PUFA and lower DHA/EPA values for anchoveta eggs in 2007 may have resulted from increased consumption of larger herbivorous copepods or direct consumption of larger phytoplankton, prey typical of cold upwelling conditions. Conversely, elevated SAFA and MUFA levels in 2005 may have resulted from consumption of smaller omnivorous/carnivorous copepods by adult fish.},

Abnormalities at hatching are usual outside the 16–22°C range. Higher survival at the stage of mouth opening occurred between 16 and 22°C; outside this range mortality and abnormalities increased considerably. Growth rate and yolk absorption rate increased with increasing temperature. The conversion efficiency index (yolk volume to larval length) was higher at 16°C. However, when the complete period from fertilization to mouth opening is taken into account, 19°C may be considered as the optimal temperature for development, since larvae reached the greatest length at 19°C.},

abstract = {The Peruvian anchovy or anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) forages on plankton and is a main prey for marine mammals, seabirds, fish, and fishers, and is therefore a key element of the food web in the Humboldt Current system (HCS). Here, we present results from the analysis of 21,203 anchoveta stomach contents Sampled during 23 acoustic surveys over the period 1996-2003. Prey items were identified to the genus level, and the relative dietary importance of different prey was assessed by determination of their carbon content. Variability in stomach fullness was examined relative to the diel cycle, the distance from the coast, sea surface temperature, and latitude, using generalized additive models (GAMS). Whereas phytoplankton largely dominated anchoveta diets in terms of numerical abundance and comprised {\textgreater}99{\%} of ingested prey items, the carbon content of prey items indicated that zooplankton was by far the most important dietary component, with euphausiids contributing 67.5{\%} of dietary carbon followed by copepods (26.3{\%}). Stomach fullness data showed that anchoveta feed mainly during daytime between 07h00 and 18h00, although night-time feeding also made a substantial contribution to total food consumption. Stomach fullness also varied with latitude, distance from the coast, and temperature, but with substantial variability indicating a high degree of plasticity in anchoveta feeding behaviour. The results suggest an ecological role for anchoveta that challenges current understanding of its position in the foodweb, the functioning of the HCS, and trophic models of the HCS.

Methods  Fish muscle (Sardinops melanostictus, Engraulis japonicus and Etrumeus teres) for total DNA extraction were collected from the coastal area of Japan. DNA was extracted from muscle of ethanol-preserved specimens using phenol-chloroform. The cyt.b gene and D-loop of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and ITS gene of gnome were amplified from total DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The double strand PCR product purified were sequenced using direct sequencing method. Genetic distance values were estimated using the method of Kimra's 2-parameter.  Results  Highest mutation rate was observed in the D-loop among the analyzed regions of pilchards. Since D-loop was sequenced in order to identify the local population structure of pilchard, no obvious genetic differences were observed among the collected sites. Thus, single population structure is suggested in pilchard from coast of Japan.},

abstract = {The swimming angle of larval Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) was measured in a tank, and target strength (TS) was calculated using a theoretical scattering model. The mean swimming angle was 12.8A degrees (SD +/- 22.1). Increased speeds of flow led to increased mean swimming angles. The mean swimming angle at flow of 5 cm s(-1) was higher than at other speeds. TS values were estimated using a distorted-wave Born approximation model for two cases. Average values were 1-3 cm s(-1) (11.5A degrees A A +/- A 22.1) and 5 cm s(-1) (16.6A degrees A A +/- A 21.7) for cases 1 and 2, respectively. For case 1, TS ranged from -92.0 to -74.7 dB with a mean of -79.4 dB at 120 kHz. For case 2, TS ranged from -92.2 to -75.2 dB with a mean of -79.9 dB. The mean TS in case 2 was lower than that in case 1, with the maximum difference being 1.0 dB at 120 kHz (standard length 22.0 mm). However, there were no significant differences between the regression lines of cases 1 and 2. Thus, changes in flow speed altered the swimming angle of larval Japanese anchovy, but had little influence on TS.},

Five subbasin scale `ocean triads', hypothesized to be particularly favourable groupings, are identified in the Aegean Sea, the Gulf of Lions and nearby Catalan Coast, the Alboran Sea, the Straits of Sicily/Tunisian Coast, and the Adriatic Sea. These are examined in relation to available knowledge of anchovy spawning grounds. All areas are characterized by patterns of linked wind-driven Ekman upwelling and downwelling. All areas except the Straits of Sicily are found to have inputs of less saline surface waters offering raised nutrient concentrations, enhanced upper layer stability, and frontal density contrasts, and to have areas where the characteristic rate of turbulent mixing energy input by the wind fall below a reference intensity level. All areas, except the Sicilian Channel/Tunisian Coast, also contain abundant locally reproducing anchovy populations.},

abstract = {Transport of plaice eggs and larvae in the southern North Sea was modelled using a finite-volume advection-dispersion model with high spatial and temporal resolution. Hydrodynamic forcing was based on actual river discharge and meteorological data for a 7 mo period in the winter and spring of 1989 and 1996 to 2003. Egg and larval development was linked to temperature and each developmental stage had its own physical and behavioural properties. Two hypotheses on transport mechanisms in the late larval stages were compared: passive drift versus selective tidal stream transport (triggered by environmental cues). Modelled larval stage durations closely corresponded to empirical estimates based on otolith daily ring counts, Close correspondence was also observed between model results and survey data on settlement in the western Wadden Sea, especially for the abundance of the strong 1996 year-class and the early settlement of the 2002 year-class. Transport patterns and the proportion of larvae reaching inshore nurseries varied substantially between years. Recruitment was negatively correlated with the distance over which eggs and larvae were transported, probably because of a breakdown in connectivity between spawning and nursery areas with increased transport rates. In conclusion, meteorologically driven variability in the hydrodynamics of the southern North Sea greatly affects the transport patterns of plaice eggs and larvae and may play an important role in determining recruitment variability and spatial connectivity.},

abstract = {American eel, Anguilla rostrata, is a catadromous fish that spawns in the Sargasso Sea and migrates to coastal waters and freshwater systems ranging from Greenland down the Atlantic coast to South America and has been regarded as comprising a panmictic population. American eel is in decline across much of its range. Research and management is primarily conducted at local to regional scales, yielding inconsistent research results and management recommendations that may be inhibited by large-scale processes. We review the research on American eel ecology demonstrating that its variable life history and movement patterns can be explained based on: (1) latitudinal productivity gradients; (2) ideal free habitat selection; (3) conditional evolutionarily stable life history strategies; (4) size at arrival to the coast (correlated with distance from the spawning grounds); and, (5) temperature variance and annual degree-day effects on somatic growth. Using these ecological processes, we outline how local and large-scale effects on American eel dynamics can be integrated in a panmictic (or quasi-panmictic) modelling framework to enable defensible predictions of population responses to anthropogenic and oceanic phenomena. Due to its widespread distribution and existing knowledge gaps, the conservation and management of American eel will require international cooperation.},

abstract = {Environmental conditions experienced by aquatic organisms are archived in biogenic carbonates such as fish otoliths, bivalve shells and coral skeletons. These calcified structures present an accretionary growth and variations in optical properties (color or opacity) that are used to reconstruct time. However, full and reliable exploitation of the information extracted from these structures is often limited as the metabolic processes that control their growth and optical properties are poorly understood. Here, we propose a new modeling framework that couples both the growth of a biogenic carbonate and its optical properties with the metabolism of the organism. The model relies on well-tested properties of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. It is applied to otoliths of the Bay of Biscay anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, for which a DEB model has been previously developed. The model reproduces well-known otolith patterns and thus provides us with mechanisms for the metabolic control of otolith size and opacity at the scale of an individual life span. Two original contributions using this framework are demonstrated. (1) The model can be used to reconstruct the temporal variations in the food assimilated by an individual fish. Reconstructing food conditions of past and present aquatic species in their natural environment provides key ecological information that can be used to better understand population dynamics. (2) We show that non-seasonal checks can be discriminated from seasonal checks, which is a well-recognized problem when interpreting fish otoliths. We suggest further developments of the model and outline the experimental settings required to test this new promising framework.},

abstract = {Spatio-seasonal explicit simulation models can predict the impact of spatial management measures on marine fish populations and fishing activities. As fisheries are complex systems, fisheries simulation models are often complex, with many uncertain parameters. Here, the methodology is provided to deliver fishery diagnostics within an uncertainty context using a complex simulation tool. A sensitivity analysis of the model is performed on model outputs using partial least-squares to identify the most sensitive parameters. The impact of several management measures is then simulated using a statistical simulation design taking into account the uncertainty of the selected sensitive parameters. This approach was applied to the Bay of Biscay anchovy stock using the ISIS-Fish (Integration of Spatial Information for Simulation of Fisheries) model to assess the impact of imposing marine protected areas (MPAs) conditionally on parameter uncertainty. The diagnostic appeared to be highly sensitive to the mortality of larvae and juveniles, growth, and reproduction. The uncertainty of the values of these parameters did not permit any of the simulated MPA designs to be proposed. However, according to anchovy catch and biomass, the simulations allowed the low impact of closure duration to be shown and underscored the utility of protecting such key processes as spawning.},

abstract = {Most important causes of larval mortality are predation and starvation. The latter can be assessed by the measurement of the nutritional condition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the nutritional condition of E. anchoita larvae employing morphometric techniques in three different hydrographic areas of the Argentine sea in order to establish regional and interpopulation variability: El Rincon coastal area, Outer-shelf and Pen nsula Valdes tidal front. Sampled larvae from El Rincon coastal area showed a higher growth rate (growth curve slope = 3.575) but had lower weight, and thus low Fulton (15.71 +/- 3.58, n = 41) and Le Cren (0.63 +/- 0.13, n = 41) condition indices, in comparison to specimens from the other two areas (P {\textless} 0.001). The Principal Component Analysis, employing morphometrical variables and weight, separated larvae from El Rincon from larvae captured in the other areas. These results could be explained as a consequence of an increase in density dependent mortality or food competition in El Rincon due to a year with an exceptional high larvae production. Our results showed that the use of morphometrical variables and weight allow to find differences in growth rate and nutritional condition among anchovy larvae collected in areas characterized by dissimilar oceanographic scenarios.},

abstract = {The young of many coastal fishes appear on estuarine nursery grounds in a progression of successive cohorts, few of which encounter identical environmental conditions. Using in situ manipulations, I explored the effects of natural environmental variability and use of a nursery habitat by prior cohorts on growth and mortality rates in successive larval cohorts of the mummichog Fundulus heteroclitus, a cyprinodontid fish common in salt marshes along the east coast of North America. Variation in mean daily specific rates of growth (G = 0.027 to 0.143) and mortality (Z = 0.007 to 0.118) within and among cohorts was associated with the tidal cycle. Growth rate was positively associated and mortality rate negatively associated with the duration of tidal flooding experienced by groups of fish larvae. Tidal flooding may have affected growth and survival by controlling the renewal rate of prey resources (primarily harpacticoid copepods) in intertidal aquatic microhabitats where the fish larvae are normally found. Overall high survival (up to 90 {\%} after 2 wk) of larvae in experimental cohorts was attributed to the exclusion of predators from field enclosures. Successive cohorts of larvae were not nutritionally independent and use of the nursery habitat by a prior cohort usually had a negative ef f ect on survival of larvae in the next cohort. These findings challenge the general tenet that fish larvae are not food-limited in nurseries and suggest how variation in the physical environment can restrict food availability even in a highly productive estuarine habitat. The spawning pattern of F. heteroclitus seems to combine features from along a continuum of reproductive strategies exhibited by other marine fishes and may contribute to maintaining a large and stable population in a fluctuating estuarine environment.},

abstract = {Starch gel electrophoresis of allozymes was used to investigate the genetic stock structure of European anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus L.) in the northern Mediterranean area. Twenty-four putative enzyme-coding loci were examined in 634 fish, constituting 13 samples caught in the Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, Ionian, and Aegean seas, the Sicilian Channel and the Bay of Biscay, between March 1993 and May 1994. Eight loci were monomorphic in all samples, eight were weakly polymorphic (p=0.99), and a further eight exhibited common allele frequencies {\textless}0.95 (p=0.95). Over 99{\%} of tests indicated that genotypic proportions were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg predictions. Average mean unbiased heterogeneity per locus (H-L) was 0.055 and the effective mean number of alleles per locus was 1.17. Genetic distance between samples was low (maximum Nei's D=0.009). An outgroup sample from the Bay of Biscay was easily distinguishable from Mediterranean fish, due to fixation at a number of polymorphic loci. Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences (p{\textless}0.05) between Mediterranean samples at six loci (G3PDH-1*, G3PDH-2*, IDHP-2*, mMEP*, GAPDH-1* and GPI*), and GAPDH-1* and GPI* in particular showed obvious heterogeneity between seas. Gene diversity analysis indicated that 96.6{\%} of variation was within samples, with only 3.4{\%} between samples (G(ST)). 77{\%} of this between-sample variation was partitioned between seas, the remainder accounting for spatial and temporal variation within seas. The results are discussed in relation to the hydrographic and physical barriers to migration in the study area, and compared with those obtained by other workers. The possible consequences of stock integrity in clupeoid fish with regard to resilience and recovery from collapse are discussed. (C) 1996 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea},

abstract = {Analysis of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism in European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) revealed a large number of mitotypes that form two distinct clusters (phylads). Phylad A consists of one common mitotype and many rare secondary mitotypes that are one mutational step removed from the main type. Nucleotide diversity and number of homoplasious changes are low. Phylad B has a complex pattern of mitotype connectedness, high nucleotide diversity, and a large number of homoplasious changes. It is suggested that the two phylads evolved in isolation from each other and that present coexistence is the result of a secondary contact. Moreover, phylad A has a ''star'' phylogeny, which suggests that it has evolved in a population that experienced a drastic bottleneck followed by an explosion of size. Phylad A is practically the only phylad present in the Black Sea, with its frequency dropping to 85{\%} in the northern Aegean, and to 40{\%} in the rest of Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay. The Black Sea is, therefore, the most likely place of origin of phylad A. Molecular data are consistent with a population bottleneck in the Black Sea during the last glaciation event and a subsequent exit of phylad A with the outflow into the Aegean following the ice melting. Phylogenetic analysis of anchovy mtDNA provides a reconstruction of population history in the Mediterranean, which is consistent with the geological information.},

Zoological Studies 49(2): 270-282. Coastal and oceanic populations of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) occur in the southern East China Sea. The distributions of the larval stages of these populations provide a bases for subdividing anchovy into 3 spatiotemporal stocks for the management of local Taiwanese fisheries: spring coastal (sprW) and oceanic (sprE) stocks respectively in the western and eastern seas of Taiwan, and an autumn stock (autE) in Ilan Bay, northeastern Taiwan. Using larval morphological analyses to evaluate population similarities, we found subtle differences between the sprE and sprW geographic stocks, but strong intra-geographic differences between sprE and autE seasonal stocks. Molecular analyses, based on fragments of 740 bp (positions 200-939) of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene, revealed a substantial amount of genetic variations among populations. Analysis of molecular variance indicated significant differences among stocks, primarily due to the sympatric contrast between sprE and autE (F(ST) = 0.073, p {\textless} 0.001), rather than due to geographic subdivisions, such as sprE vs. sprW (F(ST) = 0.039) or sprW vs. autE (F(ST) = 0.007). These results indicate the presence of a unique oceanic stock in eastern Taiwan in spring that is separated from the other populations. This spatiotemporal heterogeneity suggests a dynamic state of larval recruitment along the coast of northern Taiwan. We propose a dispersal route for larval anchovy from the Taiwan Strait to the northern coast, or active migration by adult anchovies in accordance with oceanographic patterns in the southern East China Sea. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.21270.pdf},

abstract = {Three-dimensional covariance matrices are computed at each 5 latitude by 10 longitude location flora approximately 30 degrees S-60 degrees N at depths of 0m, 200m, 400m from temperature anomalies about the mean annual cycle for the 13 yeats from 1979-1991. Lags are chosen to focus on seasonal-to-intgrannual time scales resolved on gyre-to-basin space scales. These sample covariance maU'ices are fitted with a second-order auto-regressive (AR) model, allowing for the detection of horizontal wave propagation in the presence of dissipation. Over most of the ocean and at all depths, ENSO signals (i.e. with zero-crossing scales of 9-12 months) dominate the interannual variability, with eastward propagation found at the sea surface over most of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and westward propagation found over most of the Pacific Ocean at 20(0 and 400m, the latter qualitatively consistent with Rossby wave propagation. The noise variance is approximately equal to the signal variance at all depths, while the ratio of zero-crossing scale-to-decay scale (i.e. 1.5-2.5) finds ENSO wave propagation critically dissipated almost everywhere. This effectively reduces the second-order AR model to a fast-order AR model, with decay scales and not zero-crossing scales defining decorrelation scales. Analyzing these covariance statistics within the framework of optimum interpolation allows sampling rates to be estimated for detecting sensonal-to-interannual variability to within prescribed error limits. Utilizing the fast-order AR covariance model, 1-2 observations per decorrelation scale in each dimension allows the interpolation error to be 0.8-0.6 of the signal standard deviation. A uniform set of decorrelation scales (e. g. 2.5 degrees latitude, 5 degrees longitude, 3 months) and 1.0 for the noise-to-signal ratio are chosen for detecting minimum gyre-scale biennial variability at all depths uniformly over the global domain. Therefore, sampling the global ocean at a rate of 2500-3000 observations per month yields maximum interpolation errors for biennial signals (i.e. : +/- 0.4 degrees C at the sea surface, +/- 0.5 degrees C at 200m, and +/- 0.2 degrees C at 400m) that are similar to those for the mean annual cycle. This sampling rate is adequate for detecting the space-time evolution of biennial signals (and, hence, ENSO signals) over the interior global ocean. But, it is inadequate for detecting year-to-year changes in upper ocean heat storage averaged over large portions of the global ocean as required by the WOCE Heat Budget Study.},

abstract = {Growth performance of a high latitude (Norway) population of juvenile turbot Scophthalmus maximus, was superior to that of two other lower latitude populations (Scotland, France) especially at 18° and 22° C. Overall these results lend some support to the hypothesis of countergradient variation in growth. The Norwegian population had the highest estimated temperature optimum for growth (Topt.G, ±S.E.) (23{\textperiodcentered}0±0{\textperiodcentered}9°C) and food conversion efficiency (Topt.Ec) (17{\textperiodcentered}5±0{\textperiodcentered}3), followed by the French (Topt.G 21{\textperiodcentered}1±1{\textperiodcentered}0; Topt.Ec, 16{\textperiodcentered}7±0{\textperiodcentered}1) population, whereas the Scottish population had the lowest optimum (Topt.G, 19{\textperiodcentered}6±0{\textperiodcentered}6; Topt Ec, 16{\textperiodcentered}5±0{\textperiodcentered}1°C). These results have two major implications: firstly, for turbot culture, particularly in selection work focusing on growth performance; secondly, if countergradient variation in growth performance takes place within a species one cannot assume automatically that one set of physiological parameters, in this case growth-related parameters, is satisfactory to predict growth for a species throughout its range as different populations might show a difference in response towards different physiological parameters.},

abstract = {Common garden experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that the genetic capacity for growth of striped bass (Morone saxatilis) varies inversely with length of the growing season across a latitudinal gradient (i.e., countergradient variation (CnGV) in growth). Newly hatched larvae were obtained from six native anadromous stocks spanning most of the natural range of striped bass (Florida to Nova Scotia). Growth experiments were conducted under conditions of unlimited food at three temperatures (17, 21, 28 degrees C) and commenced after larvae had exhausted maternal energy resources (i.e., yolk and oil) and had begun to metamorphose. Mixed-model nested ANOVA demonstrated that length and dry weight growth differed significantly among latitudes in most comparisons. South Carolina fish ranked consistently as the slowest growing group in virtually all comparisons, but the rank order of the other latitudes differed among trials. North Carolina and Gulf of Mexico fish generally had intermediate rates of growth whereas New York, Maryland, and Nova Scotia fish generally had the highest growth. Overall, the average growth rate of progeny from the 28 mothers tested in this study had a strong positive correlation with latitude of origin, strongly indicating CnGV in growth.},

abstract = {Age structure and growth parameters for the anchovy fishery, Engraulis encrasicolus, were estimated for the first time in the Strait of Sicily. Environmental factors including sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations were considered in order to explain differences in growth parameters between different areas. The sampling was carried out from May 2000 to October 2001 on board commercial fishing vessels. The age structure of the catches was dominated by the second-year-class (55-63{\%}) and the first-year-class (30-41{\%}), whereas the 0-year-class (1-5{\%}) and the third-year-class (3-5{\%}) represented a small proportion of the catches. The von Bertalanffy growth model and back-calculation analyses were applied to estimate anchovy growth parameters using the FiSAT program. There were not significant differences between males and females, pooled mean parameters were L-infinity = 18.6 cm, k = 0.29 per year and t(0) = - 1.81 years. The estimated parameter k of the Sicilian anchovy was at the lower end of the range observed for this fish species in different areas, ranging from 0.26 (Algeria) to 2.44 (north Adriatic sea). Average chlorophyll concentrations (from 1997 to 2002), and sea surface temperatures (from 1971 to 2000) derived from satellite images for each area, explained the 88{\%} of the variance observed in the growth of the anchovy between the areas. As fish production results basically from recruitment success and fish growth, we conclude that specifically for each species, relationships between fish growth with habitat conditions (mainly primary productivity and temperature) could be used to assess the potential fishery yields of a region, in addition to considering all factors that potentially could affect recruitment success in that region.

This is the first attempt at such a study in this region. Data were collected in summer from 2004 to 2007. The biomass was estimated using data collected at 38 kHz. Species compositions in the backscatterings from pelagic fish were assigned based on the results of trawl hauls taking account of sea surface temperature (SST). Japanese anchovy tended to be high density to the west of 153A degrees E and were distributed in an SST range of 9-24 A degrees C. Although the temporal and spatial coverage of the survey differed each year, at least 1.5-3.4 million tons of Japanese anchovy were present in the survey area between 2004 and 2007. To take account of the spatial coverage of the survey each year, the most reliable biomass estimate for this region in the time period was 3.4 million tons (coefficient of variation 0.22).},

abstract = {Damage from UVB radiation (280-320 nm) in the form of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) in DNA and the capacity for their repair were measured in newly spawned eggs and yolk-sac larvae of northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, exposed to natural diel cycles of sunlight, The CPD were measured by a newly developed chemiluminescent immunoblot assay capable of measuring CPD in samples as small as 50 ng DNA, Eggs and yolk-sac larvae exposed to full irradiance levels died. At lower dose rates, equivalent to deeper more natural locations in the water column, there was a diel cycle of dimer concentration that tracked solar intensity. This diel cycle was due to the interaction of damage and repair processes. Repair of CPD in anchovy eggs and larvae could be attributed to true photodependent repair that could be stopped by moving samples into the dark. The CPD present at sunset remained until the following morning. The diel cycles of damage and repair were maintained over at least 4 days without a long-term upward or downward trend in dimer concentration. This indicates that at the UVB doses used for these experiments, there was no long-term accumulation of CPD nor an induction of increased repair capacity. Unhatched embryos spawned in the dark also exhibited a strong photorepair response, suggesting that photolyase expression was innate and not dependent on previous light exposure. The diel cycle observed here indicates that, at least for northern anchovy, the CPD concentration at the time of sampling is a good indicator of dose rate but a poor indicator of cumulative dose (i.e. late afternoon samples have the highest cumulative dose but relatively low CPD concentrations). The CPD immunoassay described here has the required sensitivity for measuring DNA damage in wild populations of ichthyoplankton exposed to natural sunlight. These results will guide the collection and interpretation of field data on natural levels of CPD in wild larvae collected at different depths and times of the day.},

abstract = {The main environmental abiotic and biotic factors and the feeding activity of adult anchovy were analysed in the Bay of Biscay during the spawning period (spring) in neritic and oceanic areas characterized by high anchovy densities. In the neritic area located in the water plume of the Gironde estuary ('GIR') chlorophyll concentrations and zooplankton biomass, above and below the thermocline, were higher than in the oceanic area ('FAC'). Copepods constituted the dominant group of zooplankton (greater than or equal to 85{\%}); the main species were, decreasingly: Clausocalanus sp., Paracalanus parvus, Oncea sp., Corycaeus sp., Temora longicornis and Oithona sp. in GIR and Clausocalanus sp.,P. parvus, Oithona sp., Centropages chierchiae and Acartia clausi in FAC area. Anchovy feeding activity mainly occurred during the day and was higher in the FAC area than in the GIR area. Food ingested constituted exclusively of zooplankton, in particular copepods that made up about 98{\%}; T. longicornis, Oncea sp. and Corycaeus sp, were the main species in the 'GIR' area and C. chierchiae in the FAC area. Considering anchovy distribution and feeding characteristics, (fullness index, preponderance index especially) the results showed that, in both areas, biting (anchovy taking of prey) is the dominant or exclusive pattern of anchovy feeding behaviour. Feeding efficiency appears to be most related to zooplankton specific composition than to zooplankton abundance. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},
